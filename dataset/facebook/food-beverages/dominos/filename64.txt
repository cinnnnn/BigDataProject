\n1. Serve your pizzas on a piece of newspaper. You could charge extra if customers want their pizzas in your cardboard boxes. \n2. Eating standing would be your default offering. Customers opting to eat seated, pay more. \n3. Earn revenues by selling the tissues and paper cups as well. \n4. All drinks would be served without fizz. Want the fizz? Pay more! \n5. You could also ask your customers to experience eating your pizzas in some non-cooled area in your outlets. Customers dying to use cooled areas should pay you more. \n6. Ask your customers to pay for your DTH connection if they want to see the muted television shows. And yes, the blaring music that has absolutely nothing to do with the TV show being aired, is also definitely chargeable - compulsory. \n\nWhat next? Maybe you would start charging customers to even enter your outlets? How about a note-operated entry door? For God's sake Dominos.... even the neighbourhood Udipi restaurant does not resort to such means as charging for KETCHUP!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-11-05T18:30:51+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150450795144957_10150451014594957","from":{"id":"10204226694693899","name":"Retwik Mukherjee"},"message":"Recently we shifted to this area and like everytime we ordered pizza specifically I ordered Non-Veg doubles but was amazed and shocked to find them in a condition which was burnt, while the toppings were rotten and with raw wheat flour.

And it is no the first time, but the previous order too was bad enough. \nI don't usually write but because this store is letting us down every time I have ordered I am raising the concern to you as it never happened in the past few years of my Dominos loyalty but I guess it is time I must change my preference.

However the up-charge is only $1 and makes the pizza $6.99 not $8.99 as quoted which is readily advertised online. I advised the clerk of this advertisement and the many times I have ordered this in the past and was looking at the quote online. in response quoting the clerk \"Well its $16.70 to order through me, otherwise place the order online.\" I promptly ended the conversion requesting to cancel any order over the phone. \n\nI Do not mind paying an up-charge for my food.

I haven't had Domino's in years and I am now reminded not only why but also why the company is losing market share and customers. In a city like Chicago of all places known for a pizza joint on every corner I would think that Domino's standards would be a \"smidge\" higher that what they were tonight. In a nutshell...boxed pizza from the store, no brand name and close to being past its' expiration date would have been more edible.\nP.S.

Oh boy was that a mistake!!!! Online Tracker told my husband that it was “Quality Checked and out For delivery at 8:14pm, my husband texted me @ 8:53 pm wondering what to do since the Pizza had not arrived, we tried for an hour to reach the store since they had taken their  phone off the hook as to not get so many calls from upset people like myself. When my husband finally got ahold of them they gave him a sob story about “only having 3 drivers and oh so sorry it will go out next”, I called my husband at 10pm letting him know to call them back and tell them to remake the order cause we are not accepting 2 hour old pizza since its now hit that time and temperature mark and would be full on growing bacteria… He called them and put in my request for fresh food and that I would be coming to pick it up. They told him 20 minutes and we agreed, I arrived at 10:15pm and was told it wasn’t ready yet, at 10:40pm I was handed all my food and told “I’m sorry” since the waiting area was packed full of other upset didn’t get their pizza either people I took my order to the car and started checking it… The chicken was cold and burnt, one of my two medium pizzas were luke warm and obviously not fresh, my parm bites were cold, the deep dish and the pasta bowl were the only things warm from my order… I walked back inside and had to wait another 10 minutes to be acknowledged again where all they offered “was to make it fresh THIS TIME” ARE YOU KIDDING ME THIS IS WHY WE CALLED BACK AN HOUR AGO WAS FOR FRESH FOOD TO BE MADE!!!!!!!!!! They said they would give me my money back and remake the food, I’m still waiting for my money and no I didn’t wait any longer since it had already been a 4 hour fiasco!!!!!!!

I ordered from this Domino's location because it was new built in the area. I ordered my pizza online. When I went to pick it up the delivery driver took my pizza. Now mind you, my husband was due to leave for work in 20 minutes and had no dinner and had to leave hungry! They had no apologies, no supervisor, and no compensation for my inconvenience (coupon, % off, anything). I tried to contact the supervisor Beret via the phone number the worker gave me and I got a general vm message just stating the number. What manager doesn't have a greeting on their vm stating their title and name. Then I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and ordered from them again, online. My husband went to pick up the pizza and they told him that they couldn't find it and that he would have to wait 45 minutes for another pizza. No explanation whatsoever. Mind you if you order online it shows you the progress of the pizza (prepared, cooking, ready for pick up) and it said that it was ready for pick up online yet they claimed to not even find it in the system.

The documentary clearly shows Mathew calling and leaving messages on Tracey's phone at least 5 times, yet on camera she denies receiving any messages.  She then proceeds to shut down any chance of an interview and Mathew leaves without any comment from Tracy.  One can only imagine the conversation that went on while the camera was off.  Legal action threatened? Why could she not just entertain the notion and provide a 'We'll consider it, but it would probably be too expensive' sort of answer. To totally shut down any discussion is ridiculous and incompetent.  Dominos, you should be able to find a better PR person than this.  That was a joke.  I don't want to hear 'oh, they edited it to make us look bad', that's crap.  A good PR person can deal with a guy who is making a documentary for SBS.

I never order this cut because it causes the pizza to cool too fast. My order tonight, arrived ice cold. Apparently one has to call and request this not be done, which I now have. I wish I had known this before ordering. \n\nCompliment: Dave of Store #7513 was very courteous and did not hesitate to replace my pizza. He has always been a pleasure to deal with.\n\nSuggestion: Add a button or some such mod to the site to allow customers to order pizza sliced the way they want and even save the choice. I've never liked large or extra large sliced into six wedges. It makes the wedges too large.

It took them a half hour before it was 'out for delivery.' After that, I waited another hour before someone FINALLY showed up at my boyfriend's. Out of the five (six?) things I ordered, the only thing that came 100% correct of all that was the root beer! Chicken wings were Buffalo instead of Honey/Garlic BBQ, the pasta was sans sauce instead of normal (would had ordered extra if it was an option), the bread-sticks were on the extra-crispy side with the wrong dipping sauce, and the pizza was completely wrong. Supposedly, the driver had gotten stuck over a bridge, but they offered a reissue provided that it gets picked up. I was in tears, and someone else had handled the call or I would have simply wanted a refund. The reorder took another half hour (15 each way, and if the bridge was the problem, why was it so easy for pick up?), and I was just completely distraught by the time I got to eat. Over two hours to get a pregnant woman food is unforgivable and that store burnt my return customer bridge. \n\nAnd tonight, this \"plain cheese\" pictured has more cheese than my \"Wisconsin Six Cheese\" that came from my home store. My \"Bacon Cheeseburger Feast\" was sans burger. Both were dry and included lite sauce instead of the extra that I asked in my order. The driver was nice enough, but he seemed to have a rough night with the rain. Between this and another 'minor' order mishap last time I ordered from it, I can't say you'd be my first or even second choice for pizza anymore.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-10-27T04:33:26+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150448157404957_10150448694269957","from":{"id":"10205160895199708","name":"Rochelle Henry"},"message":"Love cheese pizza!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-10-26T21:21:51+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150448157404957_10150448739509957","from":{"id":"1122077001140874","name":"Jan Vance"},"message":"Love Domino's Pizza ....

I was going to order a pizza online just now, but I called the store.  Last time I ordered a pizza with tomatoes on it, I got canned tomatoes, which I do not like.  Don't get me wrong.  The rest of the pizza was wonderful and the service was great!  When I asked if I could have fresh tomatoes on it today, they said all they had was canned.  I asked about the tomatoes they put on the subs.  When the gentleman asked his boss, his boss told him they would not be able to put fresh tomatoes on the pizza.
