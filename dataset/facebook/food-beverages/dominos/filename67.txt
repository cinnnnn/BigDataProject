As soon as he called me bro I feel he is going to spit in my pizza that was my first thought.  I understand this is not the most stimulating job its hot its a holiday so I have some empathy for those who work in the service industry because I do as well.

I understand that customer service has taken a big dip over the past decade or two but to grunt at somebody then call them bro gives me very little faith.

I called twice while I was waiting and was assured \"10-15 minutes\" and offered a credit which the manager, Cesar, claimed could be used at any Domino's. Both lies apparently! The credit, according to my usual store, can only be used at #7649 which is no where near where I live and will never be ordering from again. Now I have to wait for whoever the corporate guy is to call me back about a refund. Better make this right, Domino's.

Within 15 mins the delivery guy had called and advised that he was outside, I was impressed and surprised that they delivered that quick. He said we weren't far at all- it takes at least 5 mins to get to my house so that means they cooked the pan pizza within 10 mins- which is too fast fast for a pan pizza. Ate one slice and 2 bites realizing the dough was undercooked. Had to call Domino's back to explain the situation- the assistant manager was nice enough to apologize and said he will send a new one over in 30 mins. But now my stomach hurts :( so disappointed that they rushed my order although I was impressed  but how fast the delivery was, I just hope that they were consistent and made sure it was cooked all the way through.\n\n30 mins later: Delivery guys called he and was upset, telling me his out in the front of the house- i was outside my house for 2 mins waiting for him then he realizes he was in the wrong block! He gave my food but did not have the replacement for the parmesan bites . I had asked him and he said he don't know that they just gave him the pizza. Now i'm just beyond disappointed- i paid for something i cant even eat, although i know i can just put the bites in the toaster oven its just upsetting that the reason why i got food delivered so i can avoid having to do the cooking myself.

I pointed out that I simply ordered what was available off the app.  The gentleman working was polite, but refused to honor the nationally advertised price.

I also encourage friends and co workers not to eat there due to the lack of their poor customer service.  A while back lets say a couple months ago we ordered a pizza from our local store like we always have and the same store that has delivered to our house since they were opened years and years ago.  We get a phone call saying they do not deliver to our address and we would have to come pick it up.  Wait a minute we have always had delivery here and online shows this location as our delivery store.  We are then told that thats a lie and we have never had pizza delivered to our address and the website was wrong and they were calling to have it corrected.  First off since when is it policy i dont care if its a franchise or not to call your customer a liar.  I have plenty of email receipts and order confirmations from where they DELIVERED to my house.  But yet I am a LIAR.  Good service...and guess what several months later the local store is still listed as my delivery store...HMM go figure...my wife calls corporate and they say all they can do is get in touch with the owner since it is a franchise and if we dont hear nothing back within 3 days to contact them back...well 3 days go by nothing...we call corporate again...no answer...no call back...and its been months.  I just want to say this is terrible service by corporate and the franchise owner.  Calling your customers liars and no one cares not even corporate is ridiculous.  All i wanted was a pizza delivered like it has been since the store opens...but instead called a liar and told the website is wrong and will be corrected...like i said even though guess what it still is my delivery store.  But i figured I would post here so everyone can see our terrible experience and why we have given up on dominos and also told our friends, family, and coworkers to do the same.

Stood there for 15 more minutes and finally asked the manager to find out where my food was...explained the situation....and asked for a refund of the money that I had paid more than a half hour before.  She said that she could not refund the money but that she would call the general manager.  After getting off the phone she told me that the GM was on her way, should be there in 5 minutes, and that I could wait there for her to arrive and she would get me a refund.  I agreed.  In the meantime my order was ready finally.  They put in under a heat lamp.  20 minutes pass as I wait patiently.  Still no GM.  My son's birthday party is underway but I am not there and no one has eaten, more than an hour later.  I spoke with the assistant manager yet again and left my name, phone number, and asked her to remake the order (she wanted me to take chicken that had been sitting under a heat lamp for 25 minutes at this point) and then deliver the food when it was ready.  I also asked her to have the GM call me immediately upon her arrival to a full refund.  She agreed and I left to go back to my guests.  It is now 7:10 pm and I have paid for an order that was supposed to be ready at 5:45.  No call from the GM so I called back.  In mid sentence of explaining who I was, I was put on hold.  The GM answered the phone having just arrived at the store to huge chaos.  I explained the situation, that we still had no food, and that I wanted a full refund at that point.  She apologized profusely, asked me what I had ordered, told me that she would remake it immediately and send it out as a priority delivery.  She also sent a full refund for my order.  When the order arrived it was fresh, hot, and she had also included several extra sides.  The experience I had was an absolute nightmare.  Thankfully my guests were patient and understanding although we did not eat until 7:45 pm.  While this experience in customer service was appalling, the GM of the Fort Atkinson, WI store was well trained and corrected the situation immediately.  I was very impressed with her customer service.  She alone has saved my impression of Dominos.  She corrected the situation, did not lie nor make excuses.  As a customer, that is all I look for in a company.  People make mistakes, but don't try to cover up a mistake, it makes it worse and for goodness sakes...make it right once it happens.  The GM and the GM alone did this.  Give her a raise and give the rest of the yahoos some more training.  I have always loved Dominos and was planning on ordering a VERY large order for another big party I am having in a few months...now I am nervous about using your services.  Sad.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-08-23T04:14:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150428715939957_10150430260999957","from":{"id":"10153324822664470","name":"Sal Aniceto"},"message":"#Dominos Domino's Pizza, it's been 2 weeks since we reached out to you concerning our issue.

My inbox overflows with this same advertisement and I see it on TV. I'm not buying. Just to have half of the order left over to get cold as leftovers? Not a good deal at all.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-08-21T20:00:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NA==","before":"MTY="}}}},{"id":"6657899956_10150427991609957","from":{"category":"Food/beverages","name":"Domino's Pizza","id":"6657899956"},"message":"Pacific Veggie fans unite!","picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/s130x130/10610830_10150427991594957_7579043525062234130_n.jpg?oh=72fdf3038577c46bc6c7d345f7ed0770&oe=55C39B00","link":"https://www.facebook.com/Dominos/photos/a.34325539956.16675.6657899956/10150427991594957/?type=1","icon":"https://www.facebook.com/images/icons/photo.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/6657899956/posts/10150427991609957"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/6657899956/posts/10150427991609957"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"photo","status_type":"added_photos","object_id":"10150427991594957","application":{"name":"Publisher","namespace":"localpublisher","id":"121559351219258"},"created_time":"2014-08-19T21:23:04+0000","updated_time":"2014-09-19T00:22:03+0000","shares":{"count":8},"is_hidden":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"10152929007769422","name":"Tina Rachelle Maley"},{"id":"764515246997588","name":"Ronald Johnson"},{"id":"1645824445654003","name":"Kristina Louangphakdy"},{"id":"10206872375912184","name":"Shari Thompson"},{"id":"629889623778233","name":"Sarai Carlos"},{"id":"1125661580793037","name":"Shondra Clemons"},{"id":"10153083379818876","name":"Zacklyn Trish Dawes"},{"id":"869099303156287","name":"Isabel Magaña"},{"id":"10206212872018962","name":"Rosanne Tamez Bouvier"},{"id":"369139046607896","name":"Amanda Ritchie"},{"id":"915440155186141","name":"Courtney Mcgee"},{"id":"701606219967213","name":"Sandra Guzman"},{"id":"239326616256771","name":"ImagineThat"},{"id":"765072126945586","name":"Julia Smith"},{"id":"837299593030057","name":"Catherine Papajohn"},{"id":"430211880493023","name":"Tyra Saroeuth"},{"id":"1601537333466499","name":"Ramiro Ortiz Gutierrez"},{"id":"10206204262252720","name":"Susan Malczewski"},{"id":"10100238306608721","name":"Benjamin DeMagistris"},{"id":"991569720868005","name":"Katie Maige"},{"id":"674710145990772","name":"Filament Kagami"},{"id":"1640970372781918","name":"Donald Belanger"},{"id":"1215640711809623","name":"Trudy Bowman"},{"id":"761986897241657","name":"Jpm Shebek"},{"id":"773381679426352","name":"Raegan Kaylee Hudson"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzczMzgxNjc5NDI2MzUy","before":"MTAxNTI5MjkwMDc3Njk0MjI="},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.2/6657899956_10150427991609957/likes?access_token=CAAH4OQQ9BA0BAAMiGWiExvdNZB62LfU8U4Wq8rucSDQgTXx62YjLtEZCYSBv3ESKOrytLohqdSc3Ku0KFrzQZAIPNsi2ZCmM46Wa16oUQbZA4aCbeI77kcCWQHTKS7JV4hoppAyNjZBzUUCDSfKf80ZC1cXo6h3SiR24mr9OR7Hm95Mvd9gwnOOzmyfjZABllqGVPAJrJ94iXNcLzZA3OsZBvV&limit=25&after=NzczMzgxNjc5NDI2MzUy"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"10150427991594957_10150428522664957","from":{"id":"10205745712774870","name":"Harris Grey"},"message":"What happened to your 30 minutes or less policy, out the window with the rest of your customer service?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-08-22T01:41:06+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150427991594957_10150433384784957","from":{"id":"872137579539853","name":"Isaacand Sarena"},"message":"Sarena Ayala/.\\❤","message_tags":[{"id":"851553981588831","name":"Sarena Ayala","type":"user","offset":0,"length":12}],"can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-09-01T23:16:40+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150427991594957_10150428026339957","from":{"id":"10203544042955725","name":"Jakob Savage Jones"},"message":"Brett Keen","message_tags":[{"id":"1108848185808493","name":"Brett Keen","type":"user","offset":0,"length":10}],"can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-08-20T00:54:06+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150427991594957_10150439043414957","from":{"id":"10206934081737478","name":"Tina Nystedt"},"message":"go Vegan!  crust, veggies, & sauce ..

I guess they treat all customers as thieves, even though I authorized payment. I really do not like to be perceived as dishonest… The sad part is, I am a regular customer….wait an EX regular customer. I discussed this with manager Chris who was a smart aleck and told me tough stuff that is the way it is… Oh well Domino’s, Papa John’s took care of me and quickly sent bubbling hot pizzas to my vendor, which they thoroughly enjoyed.

Store number 2733 in Lansing, IL, has the worst possible customer service I could ever imagine. I had a problem on June 29, 2014 where my pizza and hot wings were over an hour late and were luke warm when finally delivered. When I asked about the late policy I was told there wasn't one and I was not given any kind of discount and the employees were rude and hung up on me. I posted on here and on twitter and was contacted by Robin who told me to contact her if I didn't hear from the store manager in 3 days. I did hear from Leah the Store Manager of store #2733 the next day. She said I was given a $20 credit on my account under the phone number I placed the order on. I said okay and thanked her. Now on Aug 15, 2014, I called to order something and my account did not show the credit. The associate Darrien was going to give it to me anyway but the manager Jorge would not let him, I quote, \"If it ain't in there she ain't got one,\" is what Jorge said in the background to the sales associate. I tried calling the corporate office but they were closed so here we are yet a again with bad customer service and no justice for a customer that has been loyal for a long time.
