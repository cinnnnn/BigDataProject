It requires a minimum spend of £25 on products at full menu price in one single transaction minimum spend of £25 excludes all drinks and ice cream products. The order code is OTQSGBYK. I tried to order a large pizza, and two sides and a dip all totalling just over £25. I tried to put the order through online using the code twice but the code seem to be invalid. I then rang the Bromley dominoes Branch and spoke to Jonathan, Jonathan explained that you couldn't use any of the deals are using this voucher code so I went back online to order the pizzas as normal price but again this did not work. I rang back and spoke to Jonathan again he then explained that we would have to pay another £15 to be able to use this voucher. This is not what the email says. I kept trying to say to Jonathan that I do not want to order more food, and this is all I want, and I do not want to spend an extra £15 to use this promotional code. Jonathan said he couldn't do anything and we would need to spend more money to use this code. I was very disappointed I have also explained to Jonathan that I have been using dominos as my favourite pizza place for 15 years and that today's experience would be my last. As I was complaining to him he continued to talk over me and kept saying the word 'absolutely' and then abruptly finished with have a good evening and put the phone down.\nI consider this to be atrocious customer service considering you are a nationwide pizza place. I am extremely disappointed with this experience from tonight. I will be sure to leave a review on the powerful social media sites. I would be grateful if somebody at head office could acknowledge this complaint and call me back regarding the miss informed offer and Jonathan's conduct on the phone.\n\nRegards\n\nMike Lambrou","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-21T19:17:51+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150500430044957_10150500543889957","from":{"id":"955674777811330","name":"Terri Kosloski"},"message":"love it!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-17T20:26:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150500430044957_10150501039344957","from":{"id":"878409228886779","name":"Jefferson Mars"},"message":"Pot is almost always involved when eating dominoes","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-18T20:10:17+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150500430044957_10150500499914957","from":{"id":"1585876105017408","name":"Leslie Martinez"},"message":"Looks so tasty..spinach..mmmm","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-17T17:33:26+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150500430044957_10150505296749957","from":{"id":"813987902003539","name":"Bon B Dub Cook"},"message":"N that email sounds fake, we don't email promotions, we have a full list of promotion codes in stores ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-31T01:04:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150500430044957_10150505296254957","from":{"id":"813987902003539","name":"Bon B Dub Cook"},"message":"Mike I work at dominos n we can't change the system , we can't be on the phone for something like that too, due to the fact we are always busy n one member on the make line makes a difference,","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-31T01:03:17+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150500430044957_10150500678734957","from":{"id":"1645045139058552","name":"Esmeralda García"},"message":":)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-18T06:11:11+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150500430044957_10150505692989957","from":{"id":"820649258029119","name":"Pat Sprunk"},"message":"what was this so they could save on other stuff lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-04-01T06:16:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150500430044957_10150501041964957","from":{"id":"814272735335008","name":"Kiran Borge Deaf"},"message":"Hi who are ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-18T20:20:10+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150500430044957_10150500493584957","from":{"id":"490374314461686","name":"Umar Riaz"},"message":"Dominoes !!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-17T17:15:45+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150500430044957_10150500563334957","from":{"id":"830612686992863","name":"Chastity Marie Embick"},"message":"Take the spinach off and, I'll eat it.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-17T21:37:59+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150500430044957_10150500469339957","from":{"id":"895290617198243","name":"Devon Tybg Linton"},"message":"Pepperoni sausage onions green pepper mushroom and bacon is my life with your pizzas","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-17T15:50:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150500430044957_10150500470279957","from":{"id":"10206754008469295","name":"Barbara Pimm"},"message":"So awesome","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-17T15:53:22+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150500430044957_10150505120079957","from":{"id":"1592919204326383","name":"Jose Luis"},"message":"Nada me tu número","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-30T14:20:27+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150500430044957_10150500469484957","from":{"id":"1600856070196618","name":"Mitchell Gordon"},"message":"Looks good enough to eat.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-17T15:50:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150500430044957_10150508353399957","from":{"id":"1575877056011807","name":"Kendra Mtz Mtz"},"message":"domino's is better than pizza hut","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-04-09T00:51:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150500430044957_10150510171614957","from":{"id":"1432461670404594","name":"Alfredo Garcia"},"message":"És la pizza más rara que e visto","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-04-13T18:25:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150500430044957_10150500477009957","from":{"id":"689042054557144","name":"Jennifer Mowrer"},"message":"Yummy","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-17T16:16:50+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150500430044957_10150500487714957","from":{"id":"861191133949277","name":"Mariah Soderstrom"},"message":"Im so making this tonight for the crew at work!

I made the delivery guy write LATE DELIVERY on the bill. The order was 23 minutes late than the scheduled time.\nWhen I called the restaurant manager enquiring why the delivery guy has not come yet he confirmed that he is late and he will reach you soon. After the COLD PIZZA was delivered, I requested the restaurant manager again and again that kindly refund my amount as per Domino's Late delivery policy but he blatantly refused and started talking roughly.\nIf you do not honour this customer policy then why keep it ? Why make us eat cold pizzas? How are you different than any other local pizza chain ?\nAlso, he order was scheduled to reach me at 9:00 p.m. I had called the manager of the outlet to ask if he can deliver the order at 9:15 p.m. and I was told that sir it is difficult but he will try his best.\nOn a recorded call I told him that delaying it by 15 minutes should not mean that you keep it at your store for 15 min, instead you should put the pizza in over 15 minutes late. He confirmed. \nKINDLY REFUND MY AMOUNT BACK! I am attaching a proof of LATE DELIVERY by your restaurant delivery GUY.
