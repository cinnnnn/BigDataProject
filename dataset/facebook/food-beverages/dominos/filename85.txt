and 20 minutes,  they told us the delivery guy will be at ours in a couple of minutes. 20 minutes later the branch manager admitted the delivery guy never left , promising us he'llthe pizza will be at ours in a couple of minutes. after 2.5 hours waiting we cancelled the pizza, they refunded us but still told us the pizza will arrive in a couple of minutes. must've been an inside joke. needless to say, the pizza never showed. so my question is do you have any control over your branches world wiide? cause it seems like a certain branch in tel aviv (the one in Igal Alon) needs some shaping up. And we certainly deserve an apology, at least. i wrote it here and on the israeli domino's fb page, hope ill get some respomse from at least one of you. thanks for your time.","message_tags":[{"id":"10152816368922644","name":"Assaf Ben Ari","type":"user","offset":43,"length":13}],"can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T17:58:07+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150355816974957_1875845","from":{"id":"1624232614462738","name":"Randy Newton"},"message":"Now that I've warmed up our hot dinner I ordered rant over","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T01:12:50+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150355816974957_1875833","from":{"id":"1624232614462738","name":"Randy Newton"},"message":"","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T01:10:35+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150355816974957_1875832","from":{"id":"1624232614462738","name":"Randy Newton"},"message":"Beware of dominoes in Kaufman tx found out driver was out on 2 deliveries and still hit with delivery fee and after approx 40 min of tracker showing it was being delivered we get this crap pictured below and yes dominoes I agree to your 2 terms I am posting this voluntary and you can use this in any form of fashion as long as its not altered even though I don't expect this to stay up long","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T01:10:30+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150355816974957_1877323","from":{"id":"10206769545063779","name":"James Richard"},"message":"boycott Domino's Pizza they are getting a thousand immigrant workers to come over and work for less than min wage and are sacking people who refuse to work for less","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T15:00:23+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150355816974957_1876609","from":{"id":"861641023873664","name":"Pamela Wallace"},"message":"Domino's Pizza, you need to add GARLIC as an optional topping!

Following the walkout, delivery workers—who are paid under $6 an hour and rely on tips to make a living wage—were asked to work extended hours inside the restaurant but were not offered increased hourly pay for their time inside the store.

complain and the person we talked to said they would send us coupons for 4 free sandwiches with anything on them here is the fly in the soup the coupon they sent us was for a Lg pizza with any toppings we wanted and it wasn't for free they expected us to pay them another $9.99 for the privilege of being ripped of buy Domino's I have been trying to get something done about this for the past three weeks and now all Domino's does is deleate my posts So people everywhere there has to be a Pizza Hut or Pappa Johns or Pappa Murphy's or a good mom and pop Pizza place in your town and the mom and pop would probably be the best choice because first off crap like this wouldn't leave the store 2nd if it happened to they would bend over backwards to make things right not in three+ weeks but more than likely that night as matter of fact I had a problem with a local pizza place Duanes House of Pizza the owner called me the next day saying how sorry he was and not only refunded the money I had spent he said my next order would be on him. the way Domino's does things is pay for your burnt food promise to make it right and then they send you a coupon not for the value of the food  that you paid for lets just round up with delivery charge of like 3 bucks for 5 blocks away and a 2 dollar tip for the driver 50 bucks nooooooooo they send me a coupon for a pizza they want me to pay for I am going to talk to all the big chain Pizza places and see what they would have done in the same situation and I will post it in the next few days Just guessing they would have handled it far better than Domino's has.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-03T15:35:14+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150353393529957_1860401","from":{"id":"10205673705774651","name":"Sarah
