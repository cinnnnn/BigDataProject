I just got my order from Domino's and the whole freaking order is awful. I ordered the $5.99 deal and got a medium white sauce pizza which has very little cheese and tastes bitter (almost like vinegar), feta stuffed breadsticks that barely has feta or spinach in it and a philly cheesesteak that had a mixture of just barely cooked meat and severely over cooked meat. I asked for extra steak and cheese but got the same amount I usually get. I also asked for no mushrooms and there were mushrooms. Considering my son who has Sensory Processing Disorder and major food aversions won't eat anything with mushrooms on it, I hope his dad will eat it or it was a total waste of my freaking money. And no, I don't have time for the store to correct this whole awful mistake. It's almost 5 and my boys have to eat. At least the order got here fast and the delivery driver was really nice. I usually love Domino's over Papa John's as this is the kind of stuff we get from Papa John's all the time. I sincerely hope this was just a bad day at Domino's and not something I will ever experience again. As a busy mom who wanted to treat her family to Domino's tonight, I got a not so pleasant surprise when we started eating this horrible food. Thank God my kids don't really care too much about the bitter flavor.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-09-29T20:51:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150439955199957_10150441561464957","from":{"id":"10204187951686613","name":"Synthia Hernandez"},"message":"Couldn't say the same thing about the bad customer service I had yesterday for my daughter's birthday.

I ordered food from Domino's Pizza﻿ and asked for it to be delivered to the shop. Both bays of our garage our completely open. One bay has absolutely nothing in it while the other bay has very old antique corvette parts, which are being dyed, lying in a very particular order. My husband tells the delivery man to wait a second and he'll come out to get the pizza. The man refuses and insists on coming in. Instead of coming through the bay that has absolutely nothing in it he comes through the way that has all of these parts. Without watching where he is going he steps on one of the parts and cracks it right at the top. When John said wow watch out he said oh no I'm good and my husband said no you just stepped on an $1,800 part and the man said oh but i'm good. We then proceeded to go up to the Domino's and when we asked to speak to the manager he insisted he was the owner, which we know not to be true, and said that he was going to sue us because the deliverer scraped his ankle and yet there was no scrape, he didn't go to the hospital and instead is continuing to deliver.

After I checked your online tracker, it stated my order had already been delivered. I attempted to contact the store five times, but only received an endless ringing phone. After I drove to the store, I was told that the delivery system wasn't accurate and my driver had left 20 minutes ago. The representative stated I should go back home and wait an additional 20 minutes, and if no one came by that I could call back and she would definitely answer the phone this time. Well, I waited another hour and called at 10:45, only to be told that my order was cancelled because they couldn't find me and I would receive a refund within three business days!

I have done so each time. Tonight I watched Live Tracker and as the Pizza was ordered for 8pm I thought something was amiss when it said \"leaving store\" on the Tracker & yet at 8.15pm I had not received a call. I then called the Store and was advised that the Delivery person failed to call AGAIN before leaving but it was on it's way and should be here in approximately 6 to 8minutes. By 8.35pm I again realised something was amiss and had to ring the Store. In short the 2nd person to talk with me was quite rude & then the Driver had returned to the Store claiming he could not find us and had NO credit on his phone to call us. I AGAIN called the Store & was advised that the driver NOW alleged he called our phone and it rang out WT?? The young man, in store, was trying to be very helpful and advised me that our order had been re-made and was on it's way ... AGAIIN ... The new driver called at 8.43pm to say he was at the Home Village but not sure where to go to ... all would've been avoided if Instructions were followed ... so my husband went outside to find him. Our home is located at the very front of the Village right near the Boom gate!!! So after all this incompetency our Order was stone cold & soggy Pizza & 2 serves of Chicken sides. I again rang the store and was advised that it had NOT been re-made but they would now ... 8.48pm ...

I told the manager I'd be happy to send a picture. he said no and would send some more out right away. the third issue, we ordered two pizzas, thin crust, extra cheese and extra sauce. there was no way there was extra sauce let alone the regular amount. so I called the store back and told the manager bout this problem. since the driver had already left with the bread bites I didn't want to make him do yet another run, and this was at least edible though only with a drink because of how dry it was. I was also told at this point the spot on the bread bites was the garlic butter. we know the difference, garlic butter even when burnt isn't this color and isn't a bit fuzzy.

I will say that it was an improvement over the burnt pizza's I got last time. It was just completely not a finished pizza. The sauce was decent. The cheese was better than I remembered..not greasy anyways. The crust needed some more oven time. It doesn't have to be blackened to be right. Seems like too much rushing to me.  The biggest issue was that there were maybe 5 or 6 pepper slices, 3 or 4 mushroom slices, and a very scarce amount of meat. I managed one slice and put it in the refrigerator. Tonight, I sweated some onions, peppers, mushrooms.......added some of my own sausage and meatball pieces and sauteed them. Then sprayed a very little bit of olive oil on a pan, warmed it, loaded the pizza up the way it SHOULD be, and warmed it up in the oven. That was a good pizza, THAT is what I should have gotten for $20+. While I did see some improvement, I'd rather wait a few minutes longer, and not have the ingredients skimped on so much. Obviously, the local store is skimping.......Whether it's corporate-wide, I have no idea. For now, I'm gonna stick with my local pizza place that takes more pride in what they send out.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-09-20T07:20:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150438955389957_10150439360164957","from":{"id":"10152982127319139","name":"Mark Baker"},"message":"http://www.sliceofcruelty.com/","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-09-20T05:23:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150438955389957_10150439330124957","from":{"id":"804376546325497","name":"Priyanka Bansal"},"message":"I have been now waiting for 2 hours for delivery from Store #3379, 293 1st Street, Jersey City, NJ 07302.....this is unacceptable.

It is taking its time to take up, so I feel that I have no choice but to leave my complaint here. I called in on 09/04 and ordered pizza for Football kickoff. I asked that they deliver no earlier than 5:20 because I wouldn't be home. Well, they didn't deliver at all. I ended uup calling to see what was taking so long at about 5:40ish and was told that the pizza never made its way out the door. I ended up telling the people to cancel. Fastforward to 09/11. I wasnt home and my father in law recieved the pizza, he was a little confused, but after they having told him that the pizza was in my name, he ended up giving the drive $30. Because the driver said that the total was $26 and change. I got home and called the store manager and asked that he refund the money. His reply, well I can't besides, the pizza is probably eaten by now and cold. I told him to come and pck up the pizza and to retun my money. Well he didn't. He pretty much called me a liar and told me that I had to deal with the owner. So I waited for the owner. He was unprofessional, said that he would be helping me out by giving me only $22 back and I can't prove anything else. Said that human error is not possible in his store and told me that I was wrong. He said much worse things then that. But that was some of it. I want to be contact and given my $30 back.

At about 4:15 in the afternoon, I called Dominoes and asked for two medium pizza's to be delivered at 7:15 PM.   I spoke with a woman named Socchi.   At 7:30 no pizza, I called and spoke with a person name Anthony, he said that the drive had just left.  Would be at my house in 20 minutes.   At 8:00 No pizza, I called and asked to talk to the manager.   His name was is Victor - ( I really don't think he was a manager).   He said my driver had left and he would get a hold of him and fine out where our Pizza was.   At 8:30, I called Victor and he said he would track down the driver, and find out where our pizza was.   He gave me a $20 dollar refund.   AT 8:45 PM our pizza arrived Cold, and was so hard, very unediable.   My husband asked the driver where he had been.   Here is the famous reply, hey man we were slammed.   Do not think I will order Pizza from Dominoes ever again.

Last Friday my wife placed our pizza order from my phone around 9:30pm. We arrived at 10pm. As I walked in, the general manager was on the phone telling a customer he was called the \"M***** F**K**\" first along with a slew of other curse words. The online site indicated my order was ready (and had been for 15 minutes), but I was told it was not. No big deal. I waited in the car for 20 minutes and went back in. Again, to hear curse words from the same general manager who apparently had \"F**K** an order up.\" I was not the only customer in the store. He ended up waiting on me. I ordered extra dipping sauces, and when I told him I had, he said he couldn't give them to me because he didn't see them on the screen (he didn't look), I pulled out my phone and said my online receipt showed it. He threw his hands up, walked away, telling someone else to help me, saying he didn't have time for this, mumbling more curse words as he walked away. The poor girl behind the counter retrieved the sauce, and when I asked if he was her boss by the way he ordered around and cursed at his employees, she then told me he was general manager and replied yes to my question of if he was always like that.

I was in the store for less than 15 minutes all together, but heard more curse words than the amount of time in the store.

I ordered my pizza and Lava cake Online at 6.50 pm Saturday night. I arrived at the store at 7.10 pm and was told my pizza was ready, and that they were just waiting on the cake to be ready, it would take 5 minutes. At 7.40 pm not only was the cake not ready they seemed to have forgot about us and avoided eye contact. I approached the same girl on the checkout, and she said it would be a further 7 minutes. I asked here how long it took to prepare the cake, I had waited almost an hour already. Her response was \"sorry we don't have any cake\". She went on to suggest that we get the chicken bites instead. But I was not keen for the chicken bites having already passed a KFC on the way. In the end she gave me chocolate fudge that was near frozen, even though its meant to be hot. I was offered as a substitute, a dessert that was cheaper then my initial purchase.  While i was in the store, there was awkward silence within the restaurant, and one of the employees were shouting at the top of his voice for the full 40 minutes I was there and making it an uncomfortable experience. By the time I got home and checked the pizza was burnt and dry and was disgusting. I added extra sauce just to make it edible..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-09-13T08:45:43+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150437563969957_10150439596064957","from":{"id":"360293127510391","name":"Rohit Yadav"},"message":"worst service of dominos........i just placed a order and the status is showing that pizza dispatched but when I called their Indira nagar ,lucknow outlet they said that your order is cancelled..even it is showing that Anoop is on the way to deliver................I suggest all friends not to place order with dominos...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-09-21T10:56:52+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150437563969957_10150437849994957","from":{"id":"920119238011251","name":"Shennon Michael Thibodeau"},"message":"That looks so good!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-09-13T20:04:15+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150437563969957_10150437829819957","from":{"id":"363114750564809","name":"Gaurav Sethi"},"message":"my favourate","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-09-13T18:13:07+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150437563969957_10150437750219957","from":{"id":"418571258314613","name":"Susan Susan"},"message":"Tonight we did a phone order of several pizzas, but one we had specially made.

Then I was told that my pizza was done and they had to mark it delivered so they wouldn't get in trouble for their times. My pizza didn't arrive until 7:40 and it was COLD and the BBQ chicken chunks were BURNT!!! I emailed customer service and was told a manager would call me within 3 days and I've heard from NO ONE!!! When I called to report the supervisor, the manager told me she would call me back after investigating and would put a 10.00 credit on my account. What is $10.00 on a 30.00 order and HORRIBLE service!!! If I wanted cold pizza I would have went to the freezer section at Walmart!!!!! I live 5 minutes from Pizza Hut yet chose Dominos!
