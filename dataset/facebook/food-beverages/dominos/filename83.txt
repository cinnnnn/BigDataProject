There was a mess up in the computer with our address, even tho we have ordered from this location several times. The manager was really rude over my roommates frustrations considering we had ordered our pizza over an hour and a half ago. The manager was rude. i ended up getting on the phone trying to figure out a solution to our almost 2 hour late, cold and burn pizza issue and it was like talking to a teenage drama queen. I was less than impressed. Being a business owner I deal with the public all day every day and I could not be less pleased at her or how she chose to talk to me. In the end I got severe attitude and a $20 credit. Seriously, she was about 30 seconds away from making me a happy customer.

I am writing to share with you an observation I had when watching your current commercial which makes the effort to bring attention to your online ordering program. The commercial, in my opinion, fails to get the message across because the main character, a fictional employee of Domino's! is made to look incompetent...he is portrayed to fumble his way through calls with customers. Why would you present your employees in such a way? It leaves the viewer with a negative perception, ultimately, of how you deal with customers.

There was a mess up in the computer with our address, even tho we have ordered from this location several times. The manager was really rude over my roommates frustrations considering we had ordered our pizza over an hour and a half ago. The manager was rude. i ended up getting on the phone trying to figure out a solution to our almost 2 hour late, cold and burn pizza issue and it was like talking to a teenage drama queen. I was less than impressed. Being a business owner I deal with the public all day every day and I could not be less pleased at her or how she chose to talk to me. In the end I got severe attitude and a $20 credit. Seriously, she was about 30 seconds away from making me a happy customer. Her HORRIBLE SNOTTY TONE as she ended her call with me, ruined my relationship with this company. I will no longer order from the ELKO MN store and will post my experience anywhere facebook allows it. ~disappointed and eating crap pizza in MN~","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-07T03:25:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150363098119957_1925605","from":{"id":"10205684470465501","name":"Ronald Martiez Garro"},"message":"","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-05T18:56:02+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150363098119957_1925190","from":{"id":"1010954725590950","name":"Dave Briant"},"message":"I would but after yesterday's experience with hair in my food was awful disgusting photo on my timeline take look almost choked","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-05T15:12:46+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150363098119957_1952270","from":{"id":"10155594724845397","name":"Tom Suica"},"message":"Domminoes, You forgot my bleu cheese.

I am writing to share with you an observation I had when watching your current commercial which makes the effort to bring attention to your online ordering program. The commercial, in my opinion, fails to get the message across because the main character, a fictional employee of Domino's! is made to look incompetent...he is portrayed to fumble his way through calls with customers. Why would you present your employees in such a way? It leaves the viewer with a negative perception, ultimately, of how you deal with customers. In my opinion the convenience of your online program is overshadowed by the way your employee is portrayed and the message is ultimately defeated.

The manager was rude. i ended up getting on the phone trying to figure out a solution to our almost 2 hour late, cold and burn pizza issue and it was like talking to a teenage drama queen. I was less than impressed. Being a business owner I deal with the public all day every day and I could not be less pleased at her or how she chose to talk to me.

The manager was rude. i ended up getting on the phone trying to figure out a solution to our almost 2 hour late, cold and burn pizza issue and it was like talking to a teenage drama queen. I was less than impressed. Being a business owner I deal with the public all day every day and I could not be less pleased at her or how she chose to talk to me. In the end I got severe attitude and a $20 credit. Seriously, she was about 30 seconds away from making me a happy customer.

After one hour and forty minutes I hadn't yet received my order, called about 30 times before actually getting through to someone who informed me that my order was still on the 'line' to be prepared. I was obviously frustrated and asked for the order to be cancelled. Since I paid with my card at the time of order, I was informed that this payment had also been cancelled and that I was not going to be charged. All wrong! I checked my card statement and the payment had gone through, so have just spoken to the manager of the Balham branch trying to request for a refund, and only after a long argument on the phone that he agreed to proceed with the refund. If the refund will go through in the next few days is yet to be seen. Never thought that ordering a simple pizza could be so stressful...

After one hour and forty minutes I hadn't yet received my order, called about 30 times before actually getting through to someone who informed me that my order was still on the 'line' to be prepared. I was obviously frustrated and asked for the order to be cancelled. Since I paid with my card at the time of order, I was informed that this payment had also been cancelled and that I was not going to be charged. All wrong! I checked my card statement and the payment had gone through, so have just spoken to the manager of the Balham branch trying to request for a refund, and only after a long argument on the phone that he agreed to proceed with the refund. If the refund will go through in the next few days is yet to be seen. Never thought that ordering a simple pizza could be so stressful...

The manager was rude. i ended up getting on the phone trying to figure out a solution to our almost 2 hour late, cold and burn pizza issue and it was like talking to a teenage drama queen. I was less than impressed. Being a business owner I deal with the public all day every day and I could not be less pleased at her or how she chose to talk to me. In the end I got severe attitude and a $20 credit. Seriously, she was about 30 seconds away from making me a happy customer.

After one hour and forty minutes I hadn't yet received my order, called about 30 times before actually getting through to someone who informed me that my order was still on the 'line' to be prepared. I was obviously frustrated and asked for the order to be cancelled. Since I paid with my card at the time of order, I was informed that this payment had also been cancelled and that I was not going to be charged. All wrong! I checked my card statement and the payment had gone through, so have just spoken to the manager of the Balham branch trying to request for a refund, and only after a long argument on the phone that he agreed to proceed with the refund. If the refund will go through in the next few days is yet to be seen. Never thought that ordering a simple pizza could be so stressful...

The manager was rude. i ended up getting on the phone trying to figure out a solution to our almost 2 hour late, cold and burn pizza issue and it was like talking to a teenage drama queen. I was less than impressed. Being a business owner I deal with the public all day every day and I could not be less pleased at her or how she chose to talk to me. In the end I got severe attitude and a $20 credit. Seriously, she was about 30 seconds away from making me a happy customer. Her HORRIBLE SNOTTY TONE as she ended her call with me, ruined my relationship with this company.

After one hour and forty minutes I hadn't yet received my order, called about 30 times before actually getting through to someone who informed me that my order was still on the 'line' to be prepared. I was obviously frustrated and asked for the order to be cancelled. Since I paid with my card at the time of order, I was informed that this payment had also been cancelled and that I was not going to be charged. All wrong! I checked my card statement and the payment had gone through, so have just spoken to the manager of the Balham branch trying to request for a refund, and only after a long argument on the phone that he agreed to proceed with the refund. If the refund will go through in the next few days is yet to be seen. Never thought that ordering a simple pizza could be so stressful...

There was a mess up in the computer with our address, even tho we have ordered from this location several times. The manager was really rude over my roommates frustrations considering we had ordered our pizza over an hour and a half ago. The manager was rude. i ended up getting on the phone trying to figure out a solution to our almost 2 hour late, cold and burn pizza issue and it was like talking to a teenage drama queen. I was less than impressed. Being a business owner I deal with the public all day every day and I could not be less pleased at her or how she chose to talk to me. In the end I got severe attitude and a $20 credit. Seriously, she was about 30 seconds away from making me a happy customer. Her HORRIBLE SNOTTY TONE as she ended her call with me, ruined my relationship with this company. I will no longer order from the ELKO MN store and will post my experience anywhere facebook allows it. ~disappointed and eating crap pizza in MN~","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-07T03:26:35+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150361240304957_1922908","from":{"id":"10155639639295624","name":"Edesio Junior"},"message":"Ordered a couple of pizzas from Domino's Balham (online) and it has been a terrible experience! After one hour and forty minutes I hadn't yet received my order, called about 30 times before actually getting through to someone who informed me that my order was still on the 'line' to be prepared. I was obviously frustrated and asked for the order to be cancelled. Since I paid with my card at the time of order, I was informed that this payment had also been cancelled and that I was not going to be charged. All wrong! I checked my card statement and the payment had gone through, so have just spoken to the manager of the Balham branch trying to request for a refund, and only after a long argument on the phone that he agreed to proceed with the refund. If the refund will go through in the next few days is yet to be seen. Never thought that ordering a simple pizza could be so stressful...

There was a mess up in the computer with our address, even tho we have ordered from this location several times. The manager was really rude over my roommates frustrations considering we had ordered our pizza over an hour and a half ago. The manager was rude. i ended up getting on the phone trying to figure out a solution to our almost 2 hour late, cold and burn pizza issue and it was like talking to a teenage drama queen. I was less than impressed. Being a business owner I deal with the public all day every day and I could not be less pleased at her or how she chose to talk to me. In the end I got severe attitude and a $20 credit. Seriously, she was about 30 seconds away from making me a happy customer. Her HORRIBLE SNOTTY TONE as she ended her call with me, ruined my relationship with this company. I will no longer order from the ELKO MN store and will post my experience anywhere facebook allows it. ~disappointed and eating crap pizza in MN~","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-07T03:26:40+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150360921329957_1915664","from":{"id":"10152891919877076","name":"Richard Knight"},"message":"@richalanknight: @dominos worst customer service ever! 2 hours, 3 phone calls £90 spent.

There was a mess up in the computer with our address, even tho we have ordered from this location several times. The manager was really rude over my roommates frustrations considering we had ordered our pizza over an hour and a half ago. The manager was rude. i ended up getting on the phone trying to figure out a solution to our almost 2 hour late, cold and burn pizza issue and it was like talking to a teenage drama queen. I was less than impressed. Being a business owner I deal with the public all day every day and I could not be less pleased at her or how she chose to talk to me. In the end I got severe attitude and a $20 credit. Seriously, she was about 30 seconds away from making me a happy customer. Her HORRIBLE SNOTTY TONE as she ended her call with me, ruined my relationship with this company. I will no longer order from the ELKO MN store and will post my experience anywhere facebook allows it. ~disappointed and eating crap pizza in

There was a mess up in the computer with our address, even tho we have ordered from this location several times. The manager was really rude over my roommates frustrations considering we had ordered our pizza over an hour and a half ago. The manager was rude. i ended up getting on the phone trying to figure out a solution to our almost 2 hour late, cold and burn pizza issue and it was like talking to a teenage drama queen. I was less than impressed. Being a business owner I deal with the public all day every day and I could not be less pleased at her or how she chose to talk to me. In the end I got severe attitude and a $20 credit. Seriously, she was about 30 seconds away from making me a happy customer. Her HORRIBLE SNOTTY TONE as she ended her call with me, ruined my relationship with this company. I will no longer order from the ELKO MN store and will post my experience anywhere facebook allows it. ~disappointed and eating crap pizza in MN~","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-07T03:26:48+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150360522779957_1913317","from":{"id":"10153078986694425","name":"Debreshia Velez"},"message":"If anyone doesn't want their code pls email it to crazymama_757@yahoo.com","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T02:33:40+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150360522779957_1910802","from":{"id":"864535896945666","name":"Dean Malacara"},"message":"Get your hairy p***y off my pizza!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-27T17:23:51+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150360522779957_1909529","from":{"id":"789870044443209","name":"Marc Biz"},"message":"wow i tried all day, to get that 5 card","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-27T05:22:11+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150360522779957_1909182","from":{"id":"10153245262779788","name":"Sophia Jain"},"message":"Missed the $5 credit promo","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-27T03:51:06+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150360522779957_1908871","from":{"id":"10200484758839219","name":"Dawn Detterline"},"message":"Love the five dollar promo!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-27T03:01:21+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150360522779957_1908774","from":{"id":"10155480592775697","name":"James Nadin"},"message":"They would make cat pizza in china lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-27T02:45:40+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150360522779957_1908773","from":{"id":"799768950131382","name":"Adlesira H.
