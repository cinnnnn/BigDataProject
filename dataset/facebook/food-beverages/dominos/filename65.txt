Lamphere, I'm not sure how wide the box measures, but if it is supposed to be 4\" x 6\", it appears that's about what it is.

Bread products by nature, when they rise, are simply filled with air naturally. In other words, it will be just as filling either way. I don't work for Domino's, but I did used to work at a large bakery.

So in the end after almost 3 hours we got thin crust..they ran out of pan, we got 2 pizzas while other people were picking up ten at a time.  If you are going to advertise something you have to make good on the offer, otherwise it's false advertising.  Really disappointed..the guy out front taking the orders and making sure noone cut in line was chain smoking and other employees came out front for a smoke break....they really should have gone out back....looks disgusting.  I order regularly from this location and have never had a problem, they are always great and the pizza is very good but this promo was a train wreck....really bad experience.

After 10 minutes of trying to order my pizzas I decided to go to the store which is less than 5 mins from my house. I go and see a line out the door and down the parking lot. So I place my order via the Mobile app. The app tells me that my pizzas are ready so I go to the store and ask if they were indeed done. I was told that they couldn't make the orders due to the line out the door. I said well I'll wait to get the order as long as you honor the price. The manager said that he would.  At approximately 3:30 pm I go back to the store to see if the pizzas might be ready as the line was almost gone with about 8 people standing there. Manager states that they didn't make any online or mobile orders and had in fact THROWN THEM OUT as the promotion was supposed to be a walk-in only promotion. I reminded him that NO WHERE IN YOUR CORPORATE PRESS RELEASE does it state that it was a WALK-IN only promotion. Manager acknowledged this and told me that I \"have to take what they have.\" So I ended up walking out with an order that was 37.5% CORRECT.  While I understand the pressure that the manager was placed in during this promotion, I am less than satisfied with Domino's for the lack of quality, inability to fulfill my order correctly and lack of proper promotional instructions.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-10-18T23:08:16+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150446650469957_10150446907374957","from":{"id":"10205715471659577","name":"Kathy Johnson"},"message":"I went to the Homewood store and Dominos certainly planned poorly for this.

At that point we had waited over 2 hours. Had he simply cut it off and not given out the tickets this problem could have been avoided and people would not have wasted hours in line for one pizza. Highly disappointment, the crowd was very upset and video is taken of how poorly management handled the situation. We were not even given a choice of topping anymore, just sold one from a stack of already cooked pizzas on the counter. They also refused to give out coupons and would not let us purchase pizzas for the regular price. We were all rushed out as one manager from the back kept shouting \"shut it down!\" \nWorst promotion I've ever seen.

Kinda regretting asking for another one now.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-10-14T04:29:56+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150445550334957_10150445727199957","from":{"id":"717040963741","name":"William K.

Called the local store and they refused to help (90 % of the employees barely speak or understand English and no matter who answers the phone when you call, if you ask for a manager, they tell you they are the manager and won't let you talk to anyone else).  In any case, emailed your Customer Dis-Service department last Sunday ... received a reply saying the info would be sent to the local store owner and I would hear from someone in three days.  It's now over a week later and no one contacted me.  In the meantime, I contacted your Customer Dis-Service department again and they said, \"Oh, sorry about that, let me forward the information again.\"  I replied that I want Corporate handling this - corporate issues the franchise licenses, so Corporate is ultimately responsible.

They charged me four times, caused my card to get turned off. At first they told me that even though they had my money I could not get my order, asked for the mgr, noted yes I was angry, I had every right to be - He hung the phone on me.. I kid you not, \"he hung up on me.\"  when I called back, I told him \"You just hung up on me\" and then  he said - oh he did not.. I replied \"yes you just did\"  then he said the order is coming, So the order comes, (without my 2 liter). This was on Columbus Day so holiday it will take a while for the bank to cancel the charges, I feel that I should not be charged for the mistakes, and unprofessionalism of the crew.

This is the second time the driver ( Ramon) delivered my pizza and gave me trouble. The first time he didnt want to bring the pizza to my door because people were walking down the street . There was one person walking down to he was being totally lazy. So i walked out to the car and he gave me the pizza from the window.  Today he comes to deliver the pizza with the same poor attitude . I told him i dont have my shoes can you just bring the pizza, There is nobody out here. He said \"no, Just come and get it\". I refused to because everybody else who brings the pizza never gives me problem with bringing the pizza to the house.. So im standing outside my house and he walks to the gate refusing to bring the pizza to me. So he walk's back into his car. I walk all the way outside in my SOX, to his car to get the pizza. Then he asked for the Id and stuff. I said you ordered it and i don't have it. He said and I quote \" well, no pizza for you without the ID\". Now im really pissed off asking \"him since when??\" I never had to show ID for a dang PIZZA are you for real?? This is the second time this driver ( Ramon ) came here giving me problems. I asked him to call his manager. At first he didn't. Then he pulled his phone out and said OK, i'm calling him. Then he asked me do i have the card. I said no dude i just told you that. He then speeds off in the car and almost ran over my foot. Then i called the manger ( Kaun) he said well its a new policy since last week that you need to show your ID. If I have been getting pizza from the same store for months now, don't you think if i was doing something fraudulent like using somebody card they would have complaint by now. Then I talked to him about the driver. He says well its up to the driver if he wants to bring the pizza to the door. What kind of customer service is that? This is the only driver I deal with this kind of poor service with. He is Rude, Lazy and completely ridiculous.  The manager then told my girlfriend that she needs to show them her credit card to get a refund.  SHE NEEDS TO GET HERE MONEY BACK! We are not driving 10 miles to the pizza store to get one.  STORE #3679\n183 Graham Ave\nBrooklyn, NY.  Never again going to that shop. I would say the company but I like the pizza too much. Please give my girlfriend he money back!. And look up our history.

We called multiple times asking where is our food and they never pick up the phone we would wait minutes and no one picked up. They blamed the system that our food was like but i know thats not true. i have friends who worked for domino. When they finally came our cheese bread was burnt on the bottom and it was cold already. our three pies were barely warm which is unacceptable. one pie had the wrong toppings. I paid 30 plus dollars for this food. This is the worst costumer service i ever had from any store. I hope this is not the type of service you provide domino because i will let everyone know how horrible it is. I tried calling back for the horrible food and no one picked up for 20mintues every time i called. Once the guy picked up and asked me to hold on to then hung up the call 1 minute later this made me mad.

He never did, so I let the moderators know this and I finally received an email from the manager that said he was unable to reach me by phone.  That's because he didn't bother to listen to the recording he got when he called.  If he had, he'd know how to ring through to me.  So, he sent an email.  I responded to the email immediately.

The hero of the dish the garlic bread has barely melted butter and for all I could guess myself was briefly microwaved prior to delivery.\nThis in itself would not lead me to contact you the real reason I do is because of the poor and embarrassing level of service that Alan the \"Restaurant Manager\" displayed. He accepted our complaint over the phone with disinterest and a total lack of customer service offering a refund and \"was that all?\". We expressed that we don't want our money back we simply want our pizza and don't want to have to wait another hour for it. His response was again disinterest and after we expressed this notion yet  again said he would try and have it delivered in 45 min, this would now mean I spent 40$ to get pizza while watching the football only to receive it some undisclosed time after the game is finished.

Nope...that crap went into the garbage.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-10-04T03:36:16+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzc=","before":"NjU="},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.2/6657899956_10150442667779957/comments?access_token=CAAH4OQQ9BA0BAAMiGWiExvdNZB62LfU8U4Wq8rucSDQgTXx62YjLtEZCYSBv3ESKOrytLohqdSc3Ku0KFrzQZAIPNsi2ZCmM46Wa16oUQbZA4aCbeI77kcCWQHTKS7JV4hoppAyNjZBzUUCDSfKf80ZC1cXo6h3SiR24mr9OR7Hm95Mvd9gwnOOzmyfjZABllqGVPAJrJ94iXNcLzZA3OsZBvV&limit=25&after=Mzc%3D"}}},{"id":"6657899956_10150442390454957","from":{"category":"Food/beverages","name":"Domino's Pizza","id":"6657899956"},"message":"If only Facebook had smell-o-vision.","picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xat1/v/t1.0-9/s130x130/10348532_10150442390414957_8007915227986140584_n.jpg?oh=34df5f0b0e24d477598530859706431a&oe=55D0935C","link":"https://www.facebook.com/Dominos/photos/a.34325539956.16675.6657899956/10150442390414957/?type=1","icon":"https://www.facebook.com/images/icons/photo.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/6657899956/posts/10150442390454957"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/6657899956/posts/10150442390454957"}],"privacy":{"value":"","description":"","friends":"","allow":"","deny":""},"type":"photo","status_type":"added_photos","object_id":"10150442390414957","created_time":"2014-10-02T21:58:10+0000","updated_time":"2014-10-19T08:06:48+0000","shares":{"count":59},"is_hidden":false,"likes":{"data":[{"id":"685150858275002","name":"Dee Bryant"},{"id":"920837214624175","name":"Savion Alston"},{"id":"10205874049946949","name":"Evelyn Garcia"},{"id":"1570179719912776","name":"Bianca Porto"},{"id":"10203501489693002","name":"Albert Wesker"},{"id":"390437637823213","name":"Aanchal Aggarwal"},{"id":"466850456802558","name":"Sandra Isabel Soriano"},{"id":"10203269612900786","name":"Julia Carrasquillo"},{"id":"1583726465217519","name":"Angel Neha"},{"id":"437485793099796","name":"Manu Pratap"},{"id":"843855119022802","name":"Laikyn Dawn Blagg"},{"id":"387627138090451","name":"Tarun Jain"},{"id":"1626242230944089","name":"Nayana Sarkar"},{"id":"964717940228189","name":"Linda Milliken"},{"id":"885327111506154","name":"Arlin Uriostegui"},{"id":"1586245738310223","name":"Finn Spiegel"},{"id":"468973156605361","name":"Alejandra Echeverry"},{"id":"371035843087726","name":"Peggy Cleare"},{"id":"384321468434811","name":"Sanjay Routh"},{"id":"1571188616496437","name":"Yaswanth Balivada"},{"id":"489914831167064","name":"Vishal P Sinha"},{"id":"884556251590525","name":"Happy Singh"},{"id":"445778842266495","name":"Ruchi Kaur"},{"id":"682214398591639","name":"Bharat Sharma"},{"id":"1574626686137814","name":"Attia Butt"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTU3NDYyNjY4NjEzNzgxNA==","before":"Njg1MTUwODU4Mjc1MDAy"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.2/6657899956_10150442390454957/likes?access_token=CAAH4OQQ9BA0BAAMiGWiExvdNZB62LfU8U4Wq8rucSDQgTXx62YjLtEZCYSBv3ESKOrytLohqdSc3Ku0KFrzQZAIPNsi2ZCmM46Wa16oUQbZA4aCbeI77kcCWQHTKS7JV4hoppAyNjZBzUUCDSfKf80ZC1cXo6h3SiR24mr9OR7Hm95Mvd9gwnOOzmyfjZABllqGVPAJrJ94iXNcLzZA3OsZBvV&limit=25&after=MTU3NDYyNjY4NjEzNzgxNA%3D%3D"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"10150442390414957_10150442452484957","from":{"id":"1112078865485451","name":"Dani Dargis"},"message":"I thought I should put this out there, because I'm a very unhappy customer.

So we decided to stop at domino's and tell him not to speed around like that, he could kill someone.

I was not present for what happened the three minutes I sat in the car, until I heard yelling. I open the door to one of his employees HOLDING HIM BACK from charging at my mother.

I have been coming to the North-field New Jersey Domino's for years, and of all the times I've been there I have never been so disgusted, & I probably will not go back now, well, if he is still works there, I know we will not be going back...

When I still had not received my order almost an hour later, I called and was told that it should have said 1 to 1.5 hours, but that the driver had already left. \n\nHe finally got here at 7:20, and my order was wrong. The driver took the pizza back to be remade. I called to make sure they would have it made. \n\nAfter being put on hold four times and left there for more than 5 minutes each, I finally got through. The girl on the phone informed me that my remake would have to come after all other orders and that they were very busy, and it could be more than another hour.

I finally got the manager, and he did not hold her accountable, but did have the pizza remade. \n\nWhen it got to my house, at after 8 pm, it was wrong -again. I then called back, and was on hold for 20 minutes. The manager then refused to give a refund (not even for the $14 the pizza that was wrong cost, much less the whole amount based on such horrendous service). He wanted to give $8 back only, as this was the difference when the order was redone without multiples. After much conversation, he finally refunded the $14, although it will take several days.\n\nThe 'Dominos Guarantee' is a joke. They could care less. Although I'm sure they do not care, we will never order from them again, and with 8 people usually, those orders are not small.\n\nIf a business truly cares about customer service, they would try to fix it.\n\nOh, and the first time it was wrong, the driver said he could bring extra to make up for the wrong order, but that didn't happen.

I ordered online before 6 pm, and was given an estimated wait time of 37 to 47 minutes. When I still had not received my order almost an hour later, I called and was told that it should have said 1 to 1.5 hours, but that the driver had already left. \n\nHe finally got here at 7:20, and my order was wrong. The driver took the pizza back to be remade. I called to make sure they would have it made. \n\nAfter being put on hold four times and left there for more than 5 minutes each, I finally got through. The girl on the phone informed me that my remake would have to come after all other orders and that they were very busy, and it could be more than another hour. I asked to speak with the manager, and she refused for several minutes and was very rude. She also refused the refund. I finally got the manager, and he did not hold her accountable, but did have the pizza remade. \n\nWhen it got to my house, at after 8 pm, it was wrong -again. I then called back, and was on hold for 20 minutes. The manager then refused to give a refund (not even for the $14 the pizza that was wrong cost, much less the whole amount based on such horrendous service). He wanted to give $8 back only, as this was the difference when the order was redone without multiples. After much conversation, he finally refunded the $14, although it will take several days.\n\nThe 'Dominos Guarantee' is a joke. They could care less. Although I'm sure they do not care, we will never order from them again, and with 8 people usually, those orders are not small.\n\nIf a business truly cares about customer service, they would try to fix it.\n\nOh, and the first time it was wrong, the driver said he could bring extra to make up for the wrong order, but that didn't happen. I guess the manager would not allow it.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-10-03T01:46:13+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10150441969409957_10150442363814957","from":{"id":"10206994037515401","name":"Mandi Nicole"},"message":"Sadly I will not be ordering from Domino's for the foreseeable future. I have had them call me because they are out of the order or mess up my order for the last ten orders. I had not ordered since Sept 18 when they delivered my order an hour after the delivery tracker said it was out for delivery. This time I ordered a 20oz Coke Zero and Chicken Bacon Ranch Sandwich and I received a call after the tracker said it was out for delivery and the guy told me this time that he was out of Coke Zero (this was not the first time they were out of coke zero) they have also been out of chocolate lava cakes before. You would think that if they were out of product they would reflect that on the website ordering. I cancelled the order today because I was too frustrated with it.

The delivery boy did not deliver order until 45 min. After 45 minutes I started receiving missed calls. I called him back after 5 minutes. The delivery boy told me that he had returned to the store since I didn't call him back when he was giving me missed calls. I was told that I would get my order in another 30 minutes..again nobody turned up. I again called back at 12:00 midnight then I was told that order had been cancelled. I asked the person on phone to just refund my money asap as I had paid online. I didn't receive any call or refund from dominos until 22nd September. I called back again and a lady said that she would made someone call me. Nobody called me that day. Then finally on 29th September I again made a call. i had a talk with Yasir.. he said my money would be refunded and he would call me the next day to confirm. Again I didn't receive any call. Again I called on 30th September 8:10 pm and I was told that money could not be refunded but the order can be delivered which i had previously placed. After a wait of 60 minutes my order finally arrived. I have never experienced such a pathetic service. I give negative marks to dominos on all aspects- service, product, store manager behaviour and credibility. I would never order anything from Dominos. new pizza chains like Slice of Italy and others are much better in terms of food and service quality.
