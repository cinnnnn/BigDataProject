My own experience was so nice! I walked into the McDonald's to buy our whole family dinner after a day spent at the science and technology museum. We placed our whole huge order...about $50 worth...and then the cashier asked me very nicely if I wanted to pay with money or lovin'. I just starred. I had no idea what she was talking about, so she explained the campaign to me. She was quite tentative telling me what I had to do and I realized later that it was probably due to all these complaints people have put out about the campaign. I was still quite confused and said, seriously? That's all I have to do? Give you a hug? She said yes, or someone else if I would prefer. I told her I would GLADLY give her a hug, and she smiled and we reached across the counter and hugged! It was great! Then I got my money out because I thought she still meant that just MY meal was free! I didn't realize it was the whole order! I wish a few people could relax and have a better attitude about this promotion. It's not like you have to do it. You can just pay for your meal. And lest anyone think I am just one of those really outgoing people who doesn't mind that sort of thing, I'm not! I'm actually quite reserved, but the staff was so nice and polite about it that none of us were offended at all. In fact we recreated the hug so my husband could take a photo. A really good and uplifting experience that I was not offended by at all. And thank you McDonald's for the free meal for me and my family!

We have gone to McDonalds every day for years.  Even if we were not getting a meal we bought morning coffee.  About a year ago the staff, who got to know us, told my son I could get a discount on senior coffee, so if he went there he would buy one regular large and one senior.  The discount is 33 cents.  He never cheated and tried to get senior for himself...just me. So all of the sudden he gets told by the manager if the senior is not in the car, he can't get the discount.  I answered on the receipt where you can tell about your customer service experience and never got a response, which just show you that they don't pay attention to those and people are just getting lots of free meals by filling in the blanks.  Ok so I wrote to their CEO and explained that the issue was not the discount but their lack of value for their customers.  So they lost a customer who was there every day because we took up their suggestion and ordered senior coffee only to be embarrassed by their manager who got a bee in her bonnet and decided to be rude.  They don't care about their customers and so what if they insult a disabled old lady.  She isn't buying for a whole big family...19 kids and counting, so insult her son and ignore her.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-01-30T17:40:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152533697217014_10152558397792014","from":{"id":"749480061840281","name":"Haley Carter"},"message":"I've worked at McDonalds for a year and a half (so far), pulling 6 days a week sometimes and always 40 hours and y'all repay me by taking away my spicy mcchicken :( what am I supposed to eat on break now?!

I just left the McDonald's up the street from my job. I go through the drive thru because I want to get my food and go.This is why there is a drive thru. I order the chx selects, sm frappe, salad, sm fry and a lg swt tea. I roll up to the 1st window to pay, boom paid. I roll up to the 2nd window for my food, I have to wait 2 minutes before someone said anything to me and then FLOP...\"can you pull in the reserve spot. We just dropped your chx.\" What!!!! I ask the employee why didn't anyone say that before now and I could have ordered something else. We go through the drive thru so we don't have to sit/stand around and wait. And then what happens, you say? (you would think good customer service would kick in then but nope) The lady rolls her eyes, lets out a big huff and says, \"well, what else you want!\" Really, is this the customer service you teach your employees because every single time I go, if I have to wait excessive amounts of time or my food is wrong and I say something...the employee treats me like I am getting on her nerves. What happen to the customer is always right or being nice to the customer. I started going back because of the selects and the frappes, I guess I will have to do without because I did NOT come for the bad attitudes.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-04-16T16:22:33+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152531625027014_10152672564612014","from":{"id":"1020707374607461","name":"Frank Salas"},"message":"What is in your chicken nuggets?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-25T18:44:07+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152531625027014_10152659178512014","from":{"id":"1444321455862292","name":"Isaiah Greathouse"},"message":"McDonald's I love you so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-20T01:54:34+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152531625027014_10152657573507014","from":{"id":"1606579282934592","name":"Ruben Casanova"},"message":"where to you get your meat ?

I like the location because the people are friendly and it is kept clean. Well I purchased a Triple Cheeseburger Meal. The first one that I've purchased in about a week or so. Well I was very pleased. It was hot and to me the patties looked larger than before. Well I wanted to say job well done. I've purchased the Triple before and I do like it better than the Double. But today it was better than I remembered. Also, may I make one suggestion? On the Grilled Onion Cheddar Burger, try adding a little A-1 or some kind of steak sauce.
