She made him purchase the 6 piece nuggets and I have both receipts within twenty minutes to show for it. We NEVER eat out because I always cook and I have to get ready for work and he is studying for a test so for tonight it seemed ok to splurge. Instead we got crappy service, 3 meals for 2 people one of which we threw away because it was incorrect and had to pay for each one because she couldn't just make it right.

Why you ask, well alot of the workers are very rude. But not to mention the managers, they are not living up to the McDonalds standards. When we get food it takes over 20 min and then half the order is wrong. The last straw was when we went in there and we stood for 15 min waiting for food. I watched the frys as they sat at the fry machine, he gave us fry's that sat for 15 min. They were cold and nasty i told him as he put them on my tray, I have sat here 15 min and those fry's were sitting there the whole time. He tried to insist that they were fresh and i told him i know your fry time and i want fresh fry's. Then when we sat down the kids seen moldy food hid in the gaps in the wall. Then when you look in the lights you can see bugs walking on the cover. So we got up and left. This store has gone down hill. I worked for corprate and franchise, I loved my job but when the store manager doesn't care it bothers me alot. I also was always passed up for management when i have a total of 9 years on me and know just about everything there is. I have been to a few in Des Moines Ia that are also just as bad, it seems as though they don't care. Aren't inspections sopose to be done on stores? I know when i worked they did alot, i even rem scrubbing the wheels on carts for inspection. I just think something needs to be done about these stores up here. thanks and i love McDonalds.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-08-19T16:26:44+0000","like_count":14,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152219038987014_10152224024727014","from":{"id":"10203900691146818","name":"Kim Schnizlein"},"message":"Aolways get the drive thru order wrong.

I use to manage a Mcdonalds in Muncie Ind and took a lot of pride what went out of our restaurant. I would never even think about making fun of a costumer, after all they are the ones who give me my paycheck. I went to mcdonalds after a month of boycotting them for making fun of me the previous month to order lunch because my sugar was dropping.  Thought the chicken club looked good, so I ordered it. I take it home with me, which now I was glad I did.  When I opened the box my sandwich was half on the bun, when I went to fix it all the sauce was on 1/4 of the bun and the rest was on the side of the box and under the bottom bun. I proceeded to try and wipe the sauce off the bottom of the bun and and fix my sandwich the way it should be.  Well lets say it did not work, by the time I got home it was way too messy and the bun was soaked.  so I took the bun off through it away, the lettuce away and ate the chicken with a fork. I called the restaurant and spoke to a manager who said she was sorry.  I told her I use to manage a mcdonalds and would check the sandwiches before they left the counter, when all she had to say was \"sorry\". I than proceeded to tell her of my experience last month when I went through at breakfast time, I have a tracheostomy and get a coughing spell at times.  The speaker was left on and they were coughing and laughing mocking me, I heard all of it.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-08-17T16:03:22+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152213516332014_10152216726562014","from":{"id":"10153289092513142","name":"Ahmar Khan"},"message":"McDonalds must stop bullying patrons at 2328 Georgia Ave NW\nWashington, DC.

I want you to know that she gives your company a very bad name because of her poor manners and her language she uses. I visited your McDonalds today and she was the employee at the window handing out the drive thru orders. When I received my order I checked it as I always do because this particular McDonalds seems to always get ones orders wrong. my order was indeed not right. I handed the order back to the girl , explained what was missing and requested she fix the order. She immediately begun verbally spouting off, huffing and puffing and agitated. She set the order aside still mouthing off at me and my daughter who was in the car with me. she went on to make 4 or 5 other orders lining them up at the window yet still not fixing our order. cars were backing up 20 long behind us in drive thru. so I ask for a manager. I explained to the manager what the problem was and requested the workers name. Told the manager I would be notifying Cooperate offices.\nThe manager instructed the girl to correct the order and the manager went to resume other duties thinking the employee I guess would follow her orders. The employee did not. instead she continued to mouth off at my daughter and I. The manager came back and said to the girl Why did you not just give them their apples ordered in the happy meal? The girl mouthed off at the manager saying it is the order takers fault and not her job to do it. The manager went and got the apples and corrected our order.

They can never seem to give sauce for nuggets, and almost always get the order wrong. Even when you are at the window telling them to make sure sauce is in there, they tell you yes it's in the bag to your face, then surprise it's not. This happens ALL the time. How hard is it to put sauce in the little box the happy meals come in? Why even ask what kind of sauce if you never get it unless you ask, and even then they lie. Is this a plan to cut costs? If so, it's not wise at all. The people there are so rude and constant turnover in management, who also couldn't care less, is probably causing the issues. The entire staff needs a customer service overhaul.

This evening I went to Macdonalds at Minster (near Ramsgate)  and had actually the same and was charge £10.88.  I asked the Manager at Minster why this was and he said that Westwood Cross where undercharging, but I have also been to Chestfield (Herne Bay) brought the same and still charged £10.78.  Why is the price different.

I ordered for one Egg wrap and one Aloo wrap. As both of these products were not readily available the counter asked to wait for 2 minutes. Even after waiting for 7-10 minutes the products were not ready. After some time I was handed over with one aloo wrap and told that I have to wait for some more time for the Egg wrap. When the order was not delivered for another 2-3 minutes I asked the counter person/Manager one Mr. Md Ash...I am unable to recall his name to refund my money which was a total of Rs.115/-. To my utter shock the guy refunded me Rs.87/-. When I asked him why he is returning me less money to which he replied \" aapka to bill itne ka hi hai\". The other guy who was standing next to him told him the correct amount to refund. I would like to know through you @ McDonalds, was I a dealing with a bunch of JOKERS @ your Vikas Puti outlet????

First I walk in, and out of all five of the employees that came into eye contact with me, NONE of them said \"Hello, I'll be with you in a moment, Not even a nod to acknowledge I was there. Then a young lady named Deja (I'm assuming the spelling is correct, stepped to the counter STILL no former greeting but she did say, \"I'll get you right here..\" Which is common speak for people of color, (I'm one of those as well) I told her what I would like to order \"A number two combo BUT with a large Mocha Frappe with no whip cream\", and she rung it up. I handed her my money and as I looked down, I noticed the sticker on the register that states, IF THIS SANDWICH IS NOT SUGGESTED YOU GET ONE FREE. So when she handed me my change, I told her I would like to have one of the burgers. She grabbed a medium sized soft drink cup and handed it too me as she prepared to ring up the sandwich that she DID not suggest. She looked at me as if to say, I got you,. And  then walked off the front counter to I don't know where. AS I waited for my food I noticed a young lady standing at the front of the assembly line near the front counter eating French fries. Now, I don't work in fast food but I'm assuming that eating open food that isn't paid for an employee offense but didn't mention this. I finally got the attention of a young lady named Terria (I think the spelling is correct) and when I proceeded to tell her what was wrong with my order, her attitude popped up and she immediately went into negative mode. She went to the register to see who had rung up my order and proceeded to shout across the restaurant, \"WHOEVER RUNG UP THIS ORDER MAKE SURE YOUR SUGGESTING THE BURGER, I'M NOT PROMO-ING ANYMORE SANDWICHES..\" The debate on who rung it up was also still going on when I told this young lady about my Mocha Frappe. She looked at my receipt with a nasty glare and states, \"So You DON'T want THIS,...\" referring to the meal I purchased. I repeated what I wanted and told her again. a Large mocha frappe with NO WHIP CREAM. Then she disputed me saying, \"Well, YOU DID'NT TELL ME THAT A MINUTE AGO,...!\" She went over to the trash can and scooped the whipped cream off my frappe and at my request didn't make another one. Now I'm being as polite as I can, but my temper is at it's peak. I asked her what her name was and she said it under her breath and I asked again and she said it louder. I told her I didn't mean to piss anybody off which she had no comment for. Guys listen, aside from all the negative critics, the stories about how bad the food is, I still try to support restaurants that are in my neighborhood. I have never had such a bad experience at this restaurant, and have been there on other occasions and was met with great smiles and happy employees. Don't for once believe that sustainability comes from having bodies on the floor, it comes from having Happy employees. If your employees aren't happy maybe you as a company and as store managers can engage your staff and help them to understand the principals of GREAT customer service and not have them handling your patrons as if them being there is solely for the companies profit. A bad attitude can affect your food cost, the atmosphere of your establishment, AND the level of morality and enjoyment for those who are trying to do the right thing and make your store a great place to come and eat.

I even tell them when i order i will wait for fresh and they have me wait but i still get garbage when i open the bag. you have gotten to where you nickel and dime people for everything from sauces to condiments. you never see chick fil la do that so you cant even use the excuse of food costs. when the day comes i have to pay to have mayo on a hamburger there is a problem because everybody eats mayo on their burgers. one sauce for a 10 piece nugget is not enough. mcdonalds was always my favorite fast food place to eat but you have for sure lost your way. i just hope you can find your way back.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-08-02T09:02:56+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152187380667014_10152187721102014","from":{"id":"10205746756524154","name":"Gloriamarie Amalfitano"},"message":"Gee, McDonald's... so nice to you to fail to give me the fries I ordered.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-08-02T00:54:14+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152187380667014_10152189271912014","from":{"id":"744626415658454","name":"Tac AudioVideo"},"message":"Never Again will I go to McDonalds as long as Obama's face is on it!

Right?  Well, it didn't work out that well today.  I went to McDonald's 608 W Hwy 79 Hutto, TX 78634 this morning at 10:12 a.m. after two hours of exercise at the gym.  Perfect idea?  Well, not really.  First, signs everywhere that they can only accept cash. Okay, stuff happens but I'm kind of surprised they don't have a backup since everybody's phone can accept credit cards nowadays. Fortunately, that's not a problem for me so I order one Big Breakfast and a small cup of coffee.  Cashier was having problems making change but it probably was a first for him.  He had some attitude when I realized he hadn't asked me about cream for the coffee and asked to have some.  Apparently, that was was worthy of a half-eye roll.  Then, I wait.  And waited until about five orders past my number.  And, finally ask, \"What happened to my breakfast order?\"   Was told, \"We gave it to somebody else.\"  No apologies.  My response, \"Well, I didn't get my order.\"  Staff response was to agree to remake the order. Again, I wait.  I was obviously put at the end of the now much longer line of orders.  And, I wait some more.  Finally, I get the meal and coffee.  When I sit down, I realize that I didn't get the full order and go back up for the hash brown.  Keep in mind, my food is cooling off while this is all happening.  When I get back to my food finally, the coffee is lukewarm (didn't feel that hot when I picked it up originally) and the my meal is room temperature.  Oh yeah, I'm feeling it!

I went to the McDonalds on Wade Green in Kennesaw, GA. I ordered a #6 with a coke, a bbq ranch burger, and a bacon cheddar mcchicken sandwich. I ordered at 1:51, and they made me pull around, I didn't get my food until 2:06, so I had to wait 15 minutes. Also, when the girl walked it out, she was walking incredibly slow like there was no rush for her, plus they were missing fries. So I told her and she went back and grabbed the fries for me very kindly :), and then I drove away. When i got home I realized there was no straw (so terrible! jk lol), but that two of the burgers they gave me weren't even the right burgers. One was a grilled onion and cheddar, and the other wasn't the #6 but it was the #7 i think and it even had pickles (I asked for no pickles too). So everything about the order was wrong except for the McChicken. I'm not mad or anything...just sucks I couldn't go back cuz I was almost late for work then.

We went into the Mcdonalds at the A1M Extra garage in Peterborough and the girl whom served us was rude and seemed not to be interested in us. Then when we got back home we found the wrap we got was not the one we ordered and then we found that she had forgotten the apple pies. So we had to go all the back to pick them up. When we decided to complain we were met with giggles and comments from our original server and one of your senior servers. The only person whom seemed to care about our complaint was your shift manager whom offered us free meals. But I am sorry that is not good enough this is the second or third time that our order from this Mcdonalds has been wrong and a free meal does not cover the cost of petrol which was wasted doing a double journey covering nearly 50 miles. I work in the customer service industry myself and if I was to treat my customers the same way I would get no business, in future I think I will continue on to the city center and go elsewhere.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-07-23T12:32:05+0000","like_count":19,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152158321342014_10152158332542014","from":{"id":"10155506659330494","name":"Jason Lee Stephenson"},"message":"FAKE FOOD, youtube it, that crap doesn't decompose","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-07-16T16:54:26+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152158321342014_10152218279917014","from":{"id":"10206955761319494","name":"Nikki Gilbert"},"message":"Maccas please get on board and use only free range eggs.
