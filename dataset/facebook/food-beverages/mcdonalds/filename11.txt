I calculated the calories in just one of these meals and it's close to an average person's daily caloric requirement for an entire day.  How come McDonald's won't divulge that?  I remember occasionally going to McDonald's as a child (around 1970) and I would get a small hamburger, small fry, and small drink and I was never obese.  Now, it's not uncommon to see obese children eating McDonald's routinely.  Why won't McDonald's and all of the fast food industry divulge the fact that their food is unhealthful and if eaten routinely will probably lead to obesity.  We're freshly minting a generation of fat kids everyday and most of these children eat fast food from birth to death.  There's nothing \"lovin'\" about that and, in fact, the opposite is true.

When I order a steak, I don't get a little bit of chicken on the end. When I get French toast, pretty sure half of the piece isn't going to be pancakes. FOR years when ever it is SHAMROCK shake time that is pretty much the only flavor you can get. Why, because chocolate tastes like mint and vanilla tastes like mint.

My daughter asked me for a shamrock shake Friday night so I stopped at the McDonald's at  721 N Cedar Crest Blvd, Allentown, PA 18104.  Now this McDonald's is typically always slow so when I saw the drive through line was really long, again, I parked my car to go in instead.  When I went to step out of my vehicle my foot stepped on a large sheet of ice and I fell out of my car flat on my rear end.  Nothing was broken and I was ok except for some sore muscles and bruising.  After I shook it off I went into the store, placed my order and paid for it.  It wasn't until after I paid for it that I asked to speak to a manager.  I assured the cashier that it was not about her and proceeded to tell her what happened.  At the time the manager was making sandwiches so he never bothered to come out but did manage to ask if I was ok or if I wanted someone to carry out my food.  So no you don't want to see where the ice is so you can put a pylon out so no one else falls?  So no you don't care enough to come out from making a big mac to just apologize that I fell?  I wasn't looking for any hand outs, but seriously not even a personal apology???  Definitely was not feeling the Lovin at McDonald's that night and honestly don't think I'll be returning to that location again.","message_tags":[{"id":"50245567013","name":"McDonald's","type":"page","offset":148,"length":10},{"id":"50245567013","name":"McDonald's","type":"page","offset":1262,"length":10}],"can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-02-18T13:39:34+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152589445177014_10152596970212014","from":{"id":"1590875951152234","name":"Avery Patrick"},"message":"I love McDonalds.
