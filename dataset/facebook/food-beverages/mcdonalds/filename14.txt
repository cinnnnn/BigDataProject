We thought the sign said that the lobby was open 24 hours, but it\nwas locked, so we went through the drive through where we ordered a double\ncheeseburger meal with a coke; a double quarter pounder meal (ketchup only)\nlarge, with a rootbeer; and a 10 piece nugget with fries and a small chocolate\nshake. Our total came to $24 and some change. I pulled up to the first window\nand was greeted by a young man. I did not see a name tag on any employee, so I\ncannot give names. The young man told me my total and I gave him $30.00. He\ngave me loose change for my money and I had to tell him he owed me another\n$5.00. He looked at me for a few moments and I told him I gave him a 10 and a\n20. Finally, he said \"Oh yeah, you did.\" He left to get a key to\nretrieve my change with no apology or remark. I honestly almost left then b/c I\nbelieve 100% that he was trying to short change me. However, I didn't, as it\nwas my son who was paying. We pulled up to the next window and again were not\ngreeted. Another sullen man finally gave me a bag of food and 2 drinks and told\nme he'd be back with the fries. I had my son check the food and we had received\na double quarter pounder with everything on it, 10 piece nuggets and a Big Mac.\nThe root beer was also the wrong size. Annoyed, I told my son we’d return it\nwhen I got the fries. A counter person had already opened the window and heard\nus having this discussion and rudely replied (although no one was speaking to\nhim) “I’ve got your fries right here.” I told them the order was messed up and\nhe walked away and had a woman help me. She was the only one who was civil to\nme throughout this whole incident, but seemed unable to grasp what we were\ntrying to get. Eventually they took our food, and the 3 of them turned their\nbacks to us while rummaging through the sack. I actually pulled up in my car,\nbecause I honestly believe they would have done something to our food, as they\nwere all rude and the man who took my money kept looking over his shoulder back\nat us. I refused to take my eyes off of them and thoroughly inspected my food\nbefore eating it. Eventually they gave us the right food (It took 3 times to\nget it straight and I drove off). We pulled over in the parking lot and ate\n(after looking everything over thoroughly). We then noticed that my son’s large\nfries were half full. I took a picture which I will be attaching here. As you\ncan see, his fries were half full. \nAs I said, I don’t expect much, but my son spent $25 for us\nto eat. He worked 3 hours to afford this meal and I expect to get the food we\npaid for and a “thank you” and “sorry” when someone inconveniences me. Instead,\nI got the strong impression that my food would have been tainted, had I not\nkept an eye on the 3 people feeding me. I would like someone to contact me\nabout this matter right away, as I believe my son deserves AT THE VERY LEAST\nthe rest of the french fries that he ordered. \nThank you.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-11-28T07:46:05+0000","like_count":15,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152411579557014_10152411603742014","from":{"id":"10206757171672397","name":"Tracy Gabriel"},"message":"Love their coffee","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-11-26T16:53:25+0000","like_count":16,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152411579557014_10152417214047014","from":{"id":"1671386096417558","name":"Hamid Nazir"},"message":"McDonald's Love Filet-O-Fish.

Then after sipping the same I \npurchased a salad. I was pressed for time inasmuch as among other things I \nneeded to get to the library and then off to my shopping. I asked Pam to get me \na refill (The cup was 1/2 full) and after several minutes she came back stating \nthat the receipt was required. She walked away. After a couple of minutes I went \nto the counter and looked incredulously at the woman. Admittedly I asked her if \nshe was either \"dumb or stupid\" b/c the cup had coffee in it. She then \nimmediately retorted, \"I'm calling the police.\" \"Why?\" I asked. She replied, \n\"Because you called me dumb and stupid.\" I shook my head and (admittedly) \nraising my voice, however, not so as to alarm the occupants of the store said, \n\"are you that ignorant that you can't see the coffee in the cup?\" I said, \"Just \ngive me the coffee\" Pam stood adjacent w/receipt in hand. I asked for the \nmanager and she quipped, \"I am the manager.\" I responded, \"apparently the \nfranchise owner has made a poor choice!\" She began calling the police. And TOOK \nmy 1/2 full cup of coffee. I couldn't stand and wait to engage w/police \nofficers. I had no time. Moreover it is a complete waste of valuable police \nresources. This manager is the representative of poor management. I stop at this\nparticular store b/c it is kept very clean by the fellow who has been there for \nyears. And in most cases albeit lengthy wait times the service (according to \nPam-I rarely approach the counter) is ok. \nIt should be noted that according to Pam service albeit untimely (on occasion) is good. Moreover when I have gone through the drive-through service has been agreeable esp. by (what seems to me two regulars) a younger shorter woman and a younger fellow taking orders and payment. Clearly a manager should be better equipped to deal w/a situation as such. Clearly she needs a BM. As far as \"ambiance\" I always converse w/the fellow who keeps the store so clean (I think his name is Dan or Steve [I'm not good w/names] he is very social and pleasant to talk with as he changes the garbage such as yesterday. He's been there 13 yrs.) And the layout and lighting is wonderful. Very spacious and bright-natural lighting. Yet this manager is ignorant. No customer service skills.

I asked the manager on duty, and he said all the educator and/or teacher had to do was show their ID. Today I went into another location (4862) less the 3 miles from the other McDonald's that had the sign posted about free coffee for educators and/or teachers, and I asked the lady at the counter why they didn't do it at that location ? All she could say is we don't do it here. I didn't have time to ask the manager. Can you please tell me why one McDonald's would be doing this and another location wouldn't. The sign said that this was not just for Virginia educators and/or teachers, but the greater Washington DC Metro area which would include Maryland and the District of Columbia. It would seem to me this would really cause some confusion, not only with customers that visit more then one of your locations during the work week, but also for the staff members at some of your restaurants where they are not doing this promotion. It was nice to see the man that runs McDonald's, the CEO, on CBS Sunday Morning two weeks ago. It's nice to see that their our still large Corporation's where you can still work your way all the way up to the top, if that's what you want to do.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-11-03T17:57:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152367567257014_10152372436932014","from":{"id":"10206451090146461","name":"Debra Coleman"},"message":"So apparently $3 is a lot to McDonald's! Ok so this is the scene, I pulled up in the drive-thru (before school with my two little ones ) the marquee says two southern style chicken biscuits or whatever the other option was for $3. I ordered this and get my price... Then I get to the window and two girls are there and when they open the window they begin to explain that that option is no longer available and I say even though it's there on the marquee and I just ordered with you. They say yes I'm sorry I just got to work, I didn't know.... I said ok I can understand that but it is still on the marquee and you did confirm it for this price. Long story short a supervisor (I assume from the uniform ) came up saying the same and claiming the mgr. said all they could do was apologize but that was it. Mind you when I asked for her she is not there... he didn't have time to call anybody before he came to that window! And if that really was the mgrs response then shame on them even more!! I will end this by saying we inconvenienced ourselves by going up the road to Burger King where we got what we expected for the price we were told! and I just asked how they would handle the situation and the lady just looked as genuine as could be when she said \"I mean we would have to honor it, anybody should \". Of course I could have easily gotten over the mistake, because I shouldn't have been expected to pay for it, Ha, but obviously the way it was handled NOT COOL AT ALL.
