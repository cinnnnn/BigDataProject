Hello McDonald's folks. I'm lovin' the idea of a vegan (veggie is good but vegan would bring in a lot more people) option from your menu. I've gotten pretty good with some of the (many) meat substitutes out there; so much so that my husband loves what I make. The first and easiest option would be to have a chicken substitute available for your salads - Beyond Meat has some excellent choices, or Gardein, or create your own signature brand. Try Hampton Foods' \"Just Mayo\" to substitute for regular mayo, including mixing up your own Ranch (and Ranch Lite) dressings. Finally, there are an increasing number of bacon substitutes out there, including some interesting ones made of flavored shaved coconut. If you offer these things, you'll be seeing a lot more of me and my friends! And we'll be lovin' it.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-01-06T00:56:12+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152465621497014_10152515041457014","from":{"id":"10206391100480098","name":"Penny Walker"},"message":"I'm lovin animals.

The person then asked me if it was a double quarter pounder. Yes. Is that a meal? Yes. Would you like that large? Yes. Did I not just say that? I asked for a black coffee for my drink. My Fiancé then ordered her meal and went through the same process. Our meal was put up and I was asked what coffee I wanted. I had already said black to her so repeated it. She put that up and moved on to the next customer. We did not get a receipt despite asking. We were missing a fries and had to interrupt and ask for them. Both of the fries were medium when we ordered a large, both were also only half full. We went to put ice in a drink, one machine was broken, the other was too as when the button was pressed the ice would not stop until the button was pulled out again which was difficult to do and led to ice being everywhere. We sat down and I had been given a quarter pounder meal not a double. I went back and queued to have it changed. When in the queue a member of staff took a handful of fries from a meal on the counter and ate them. Everyone in the queue looked at him. It later seemed that it belonged to another staff member but I would presume nobody else in the queue knew that and maybe wondered if that was why they got not a lot of fries either! When I got to the front of the queue and told the server I had the wrong meal she took it from me and threw it in the bin without a word of an apology and left me standing until a new burger was cooked and gave a quiet sorry when it was passed to me. I went and ate my now cold portion of half fries and my new burger and my fiancé at her stone cold Big Mac. We both went to the restrooms before leaving and in both the sensors on the toilets did not work. And both were a mess. I looked to see if there was a log for when they were last checked, there wasn't one. All in all by far the worst visit I have ever had to a McDonalds.

Slow down, double check your orders.  If only people knew how long some of you food sat after cooking in the hot holder before it was served.  Of course McDonald's rarely checks up on their stores.  Sure you have short and full operations reviews every so often, but other than that and the complaints and compliments of customers and the review from the monthly mystery shop you don't know what goes on.  I don't think you care.  As long as money is flowing then the bottom line is growing.  Your coffee is wonderful and some of your \"food\" is great in theory but people are not meant to consume what you serve to society more than once or twice a week.  Especially our youths.  As kids we saw McDonalds as a treat, not as a daily routine.  Now who knows what you put in the \"food\" you serve.  Maybe even you don't know.  Or care...  Or both.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-12-31T10:15:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152449817382014_10152463870777014","from":{"id":"455796824596063","name":"Ali El-Ali"},"message":"Eating McDonalds can cause greater risk for cancer","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-12-23T00:08:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152449817382014_10152461927062014","from":{"id":"873310382715329","name":"Billy J Greene"},"message":"Are You guys gonna stop making the big mac?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-12-22T00:51:11+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152449817382014_10152458043072014","from":{"id":"840830259330892","name":"Josmary Ji"},"message":"How do you make your french fries so golden?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-12-20T19:54:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152449817382014_10152455969897014","from":{"id":"683407235121552","name":"Zane Womble"},"message":"Mcdonalds has human Dna in its meat","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-12-19T15:55:21+0000","like_count":11,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152449817382014_10152454913742014","from":{"id":"801372236625958","name":"Macy Meyer"},"message":"I would rather eat vegetables! ur food is fricken sick!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-12-18T23:26:52+0000","like_count":10,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152449817382014_10152454044752014","from":{"id":"979033272121028","name":"Sonicia Gardner"},"message":"I really want to win for my son !
