You just lost another customer! I went to the McDonald's on Industrial Drive in Bossier City to pick up the kid's dinner because I got off so late.\n\nThe minute I pull up to the second window, after paying for the food, a girl pops her head out of the window and says rudely, \"Pull up to that parking spot and someone will bring you your food.\"\n\nI said, \"No.\"\n\nShe said \"Excuse me, you have to.\"\n\nI said \"No. Every time I go through the drive through you make me pull up and forget about me. I'll wait for my food. Thank you.\"\n\nShe slams the window, says something to her fellow employees, then reopens the window and says, \"If you don't move, I'm going to call the cops!\" I laughed and said, \"Go get your manager.\"\n\nShe goes to get the manager but I guess it wasn't important enough because the manager never came to the window. I waited for about five minutes and was presented my food.\n\nI asked her, \"So, did you tell your manager that you threatened to call the cops on me?\" And she informs me, \"It is our policy to call the cops on people who refuse to move.\" She then slams the window and I drive away, laughing at the absurdity.\n\nThis is what service has come to, I guess. I give you money, you scream at me, threaten to call the cops on me, and act like I'm in the wrong.
