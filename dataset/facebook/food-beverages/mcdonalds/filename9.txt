The cashier automatically rings it up as a meal. I look at the receipt after I paid and it says $3.30 before taxes! That's 10 cents more than ordering separate like I did. So when I got my food I made sure to let them know in a nice way that I didn't order a meal and was told that they just do that unless I say no meal. For one I should not have to say no meal if I already ordered it separate and two why would you scam your customers that way!! Yeah most of you will say its 10 cent but if you went everyday during the week then that becomes 50 cent a week then $2 a month and so on.

This weekend, my husband picked up dinner for my family after work.  Unfortunately, there were a number of failures with our simple drive-thru order:  1.) We received a Dr. Pepper (regular) instead of a Diet Coke, and you know how offensive that is to true Diet Coke fans.  2.) The yogurt was missing from our daughter's Happy Meal.  She's a toddler and that's a dealbreaker; the yogurt is her favorite part! 3.) Worst of all, and most disturbing to me as a mother: instead of a 4-piece McNugget in her happy Meal, she received a mostly-eaten hamburger inside a 4-piece McNugget box.  I'm pretty sure that doesn't meet FDA requirements!  We were disappointed to have to return to the restaurant after arriving at our destination, unpacking the food, and discovering these issues with our order.   The manager we spoke to about the situation merely gave us a replacement Diet Coke and a 4-piece McNugget  (no yogurt??).  We felt this was inappropriately handled by the manager, especially when it comes to McDonald's legacy of service!

It was a time when the crew did NOT put the fries in the bag until last and people in the restaurant were just as important as the drive through. ever since you switched to the warming bins for mass produced burger patties and chicken, we now get totally flavorless meat. Please go back to production calling and training the crew the quality, value, and service philosophy that was drilled into us back then. \nAlso, The french fries were in boxes clearly marked BEST COOKED WHILE FROZEN so why do most stores have these automatic troughs that dispense the fries into the fry baskets?? They cannot stay frozen in that manner. Are the crew really that lazy to go get a new case of fries from the freezer as needed?\nI would also like to see you go back to the fry oil formula (some Heinz formula) used in the mid 80's - Call them \"throwback fries\" or something. And cook them when frozen!\nAlso, PLEASE put seasoning on the burger patties as they cook like you used to. At least put pepper on them if you refuse to also put salt on them.\nI am available to re-train you in the old ways if you have forgotten.

My family likes McDonalds, sometimes. I say sometimes because its become normal to wait forever for our food, receive the wrong or missing items and what we receive is dry from sitting in the trays all day. I keep reading McDonalds is in trouble and I want to enjoy McDonalds again, not pile on, but the wait for line is forever. I see the managers hit the button on the order display long before our order is ready, they're worried about their serve times. Maybe the drive through time is slow because everyone has to check their order because it is very common to get the wrong item or have items missing. Finally, I've worked food service and understand food cost, thus I know having the warming trays on the line save you from having to throw away just about any food but half the time I get a dried out, nasty burger.

You should model your other restaurants to be more like Williamston.  The employees need to be able to relax and be able to talk with the customers.  Speed is not everything.

I think that your company is a multi-billion dollar company and you don't need to raise prices at least on the drink and little burgers such as the McChicken and McDouble. Keep the dollar menu! Remember that a lot of your customers are poor (like me) and we come here because your dollar menu was the best in comparison to your competitors in terms of pricing and menu.

Today, at 9:25am  I placed my order, and when I pulled up to the second window, a female employee was adding sugar to my coffee. Unaware that the window was cracked, I heard her make the remark \"I hope they get diabetes,\" as she pumped the requested amout of sugar into my coffee. I loudly yelled, \"I can hear you.\" the manager, who was actually handing me my order, asked what I was talking about. I told him \"I just heard her saying that she hopes I get diabetes.\" He laughed and said vebatim \"No, THIS will give you diabetes, our sweet tea,\" as he handed it to me. I looked at him very sternly and said \"I do not think diabetes is funny.\" he started laughing and tolf me to have a great day. No apology, no acknowledgement, NOTHING. \nI am disgusted. Not only did an employee wish disease upon me, but the manager basically warned me about the danger of consuming your sweet tea. I have been drinking it for years. How truthful is his statement. If I am diagnosed with diebetes, will McDonald'd be accountable. Why did they even bring up diabetes? Is is because the disease effects mostly hispanic people, or overweight people? Are they discriminating against me? \nI want this addressed immediately. As a paying customer, I do not deserve this treatment. Needless to say, I will never be back, if only for my own health. I guarantee I could seek legal representation and would have a strong case against McDonald's.\nYou would think, being a loaction in San Antonio's medical center, they would have a little more common sense and sensitivity.

He had to drive his grand daughter to school but returned later same morning to hopefully rectify but alas no apology ... Confusing Monday mornings are usually just an apology away from making amends unfortunately in this case now there's just a stream of collaboration agreeing to the poor services received at your eaablishment..

Two times within one week at two different locations I have been charged a different price than what was displayed on the signage.  Both times I was told 'sorry' but nothing was done.  1st time was 4/2/15 8:30 am at the McDonalds in Farmington MN (4655 Knutsen Dr.Farmington, MN 55024)  Sausage Burritos, 1.00 each.  Nope, 2 sausage burritos ring up at 2.38 before tax.  when I point it out I am told 'the sign is wrong'.  No other attempt to make it right.  2nd time tonight (4/8/15) 8:00 pm at the McDonalds in Burnsville MN (14200 Grand Ave.Burnsville, MN 55337) #1 big mac meal at drive thru - $5.19.  Pull up to window, price is $5.89 before tax.  I question it and am told that is the price.  I pay it, and pull back around to make sure I didn't misread it.  I didn't.  Person on speaker says they rang it up wrong and she will fix.  I go inside and talk to mgr, she says that is the price, and the price on the inside sign is 5.89.  Again, no attempt to correct the situation or make it right.  Just given a feeble 'sorry'.  That's two strikes McDonalds.  I would have e-mailed you the pics I took to illustrate this, but you conveniently don't have any e-mail address available for your customer service.  Pretty stuped mistakes for an organization your size.  I would think you would do better, at both your signage and your ability to fix the situation for your customers.
