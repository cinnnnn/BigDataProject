I have attempted more then three times in one week to return the pizza and wings to the store to receive my full refund and the general manager is aware of the situation and has made no attempt to contact me. Isn't this a little over the stop to receive a refund? The location is 3109 W. Rosecrans Ave Hawthorne, CA 90250 store #026175. When I finish with this store not only will they have to give me a full refund now I will receive a credit as well.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-11-17T21:14:21+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152796659202415_10152798657972415","from":{"id":"10153839801953572","name":"Jaime Gomer"},"message":"Thank you for NOT delivering my pizza today.

How dare you allow people at your store to talk to customers that way!\nYour store located at 9310 East RL Thornton #106 Dallas, TX 75225 Phone 214 324 5329 should be closed down and every employee needs to revisit customer service training. I order pizza through the mobile app from this location. I had the pizza sent to a previously used location in error. We didn’t realize this until your driver called to inform that he was outside. We immediately apologized and informed the driver of our error. We explained that we would contact the ordering store to have the situation rectified. Well, to our dismay, when we called the store the gentleman that answered displayed the worst customer service I have witnessed in all my years of living. We tried to inform that we lived across town and order the pizza in error from his store, he told us he didn’t deliver in our area, couldn’t help us, call headquarters for a refund, and hung up in our faces. Well, we called back to explain again, the same person answered and said, “I told yall that we couldn’t help you.” We tried yet again to explain that we only needed them to cancel and issue a credit back to our credit card and that we didn’t appreciate being hung up on. This person then stated, “yall need to figure out who is going to talk to me because yall (my husband and I) cant talk to him at the same time and when we figured it out, call him back” and hung up in our face again. By this time we were furious, we called back again, this time asking for a manager. The same person answered again and said he was the manager and that my husband and I were idiots then hung up again. Now that was enough to send any person over the edge. We waited for about 5 minutes and called back yet again. This time a young lady answered the phone. She asked if we were the one that had just called, rudely, I said yes and that I needed to speak with the person in charge. She tried to assist herself but it was too late, she finally put a manger by the name of Chrystal on the phone. Chrystal apologized for the incident and stated that she had already had to speak with the gentleman regarding his behavior. I told her that was of no concern to me. If he had done this before, there is no way he should have been allowed to answer calls on behalf of the company. I explained that I was only one person but who knew how many other customers he had turned away from your establishment. I will admit, Chrystal did everything in her power to correct the situation but by this time again, it was too late.\nWhile Chrystal was speaking with my husband on another line to get our order placed at the location near us, I spoke with your complaints line. I informed him of all that had transpired and the young man was very apologetic and stated that he would escalate this further. I asked if calls were recorded and he informed me that they were not. How do you measure the quality of service given by your store locations? Do you not have quality analyst that will monitor random calls to ensure your customers are being treated fairly?  Chrystal tried repeatedly to contact the store in our area to assist us in getting our order but was unable to get through for about 15 minutes. She then gave us the name and number of Jason at the Cedar Hill TX location. We tried again but the phones were turned off. How do you turn off phones that add revenue to your establishment? We ended up going to another pizza location where we were treated great.\nI’m hoping this will assist you in seeing how customers are being treated.  In today’s time, customer service is a key factor to the success and or demise of any company. I will not say that I will never use your services again but I will consider other options before I do. It’s sad that you have a wonderful product but your customer service deters individuals from utilizing it.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-11-06T16:39:27+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152735140582415_10152771085997415","from":{"id":"999165090094359","name":"Amilcar S.
