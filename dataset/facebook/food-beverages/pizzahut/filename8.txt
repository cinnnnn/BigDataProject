Every time I order I request jalape√±os on the meat lovers pizza and almost every time they forget to put to add the jalape√±os.  Tonight I ordered the usual and again they forgot to add the jalape√±os so they said they would remake the pizza. They took the pizza away brought it back a few minutes later what we thought was a new pizzq with jalape√±os,  we didn't check it took our order home only to find that all the person did was throw a bunch of jalape√±os on top of one side of the pizza and bring it back. I am very disappointed in the type of service this store has to offer.  May have to take our business elsewhere.  What kind of people does Pizza Hut hire? Customers should not be treated like this. Also the hot wings we received were barbecue and not hot or spicy,  they were horrible.
