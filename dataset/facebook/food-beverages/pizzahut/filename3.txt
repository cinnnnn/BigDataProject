I received a pizza that was not what we ordered so I called and spoke with a gentleman who said we would have a credit to use in the future. I called your store located in Saint Charles, MO, the Harvester location and spoke with the manager/owner named Paula. She informed me that my credit had fallen off the system and she was sorry. I was not told that you only had 30 days to use a credit and she said it is company policy that we tell our customers just that. (does it make any sense that I would let a pizza that was my compensation for an incorrect one just expire? I have three teenagers, they eat pizza, a lot of pizza). When I told her I felt like I was mislead about being compensated she HUNG UP ON ME, then would not answer my calls until I called from another number. You know social media can be the death of your business, you know customers talk, you know we will share our awful experiences. Let’s say I have 500 friends on Facebook, and I post about this horrific experience, and my friends share my experience, then some of their friends share it, you see the snowball effect I am getting at. How do you resolve these issues? I was in hospitality and believe as a business, customers have a choice and that when they visit my establishment I go above and beyond to make their experience one they’ll never forget. This particular Pizza Hut is on a service road with Imo’s, Papa John’s and Dominos. While I know your establishment has been there for over 20 years, it doesn’t do the amount of business it used to. I wonder why that is and I’m sure if you look at your revenue reports you would come to the same conclusion. It appears this store has its own philosophy; I’m the owner, I run the store, I can treat customers however I see fit, they’re not worth keeping, we can mess up a pizza and not compensate for it. I work hard for my money, it is my choice to support your business, or I should say I did. My last piece of wisdom for whomever may read this is this; GET BACK TO THE BASICS. YOU WANT TO STAND OUT, FOCUS ON CUSTOMER SERVICE.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-04-01T14:53:17+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10153079724267415_10153080885567415","from":{"id":"924731837571906","name":"Sabrina Dennis"},"message":"Yummy","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-31T16:24:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10153079724267415_10153092904402415","from":{"id":"469483876553160","name":"Joey Suprunowski"},"message":"@PizzaHut I was supposed to be emailed","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-04-06T15:39:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10153079724267415_10153079914172415","from":{"id":"956805377686975","name":"Patricia Wyman"},"message":"I ordered from there 4 times last week but could only do 2 surveys....That was disappointing...I just HAD to order again today though :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-31T01:20:38+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10153079724267415_10153080842077415","from":{"id":"696709060458571","name":"Syed Taha Hasnain"},"message":"yummy","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-03-31T15:53:39+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDI=","before":"NjY="},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.2/6053772414_10153079724337415/comments?access_token=CAAH4OQQ9BA0BANlCtltIDiC6fjU8cSuKFTZCqg8U18isZCzqPJApWUOgZBLpY9l6jsmCDwYg3XJVWWLzGsNeLfO0FVi2zkZAsBlA3pYZBqPbHOiaKIZCKW6QH4O6PYdfSwfvUlxeZCwAnxmgkSm9QZCP3oHF6SalPIt5K3X4xr5o1ZBAhImFzw7YogqhaFzYO9iy847eeLzhczYf6eCuEo7lN&limit=25&after=NDI%3D"}}},{"id":"6053772414_10153078968497415","from":{"category":"Food/beverages","name":"Pizza Hut","id":"6053772414"},"message":"Monday mornings are marginally improved by coffee.

He cursed in front of me , literally yelled at me because my apartment light was off, which I kept telling him it was out but he didn't care, and I still was going to give him a tip. I handed him a 20 and asked for 3 back my order was just over $14. And he said he didn't have ones so I was FORCED to give him a % 33 tip!!! And what did he say? He never said thank you or even appreciated it! Instead the last thing he said before turning around and leaving me standing there ? \" if the light isn't on next time we will not deliver to you!\" This is not the first time I ordered delivery without my light on.

I received a pizza that was not what we ordered so I called and spoke with a gentleman who said we would have a credit to use in the future. I called your store located in Saint Charles, MO, the Harvester location and spoke with the manager/owner named Paula. She informed me that my credit had fallen off the system and she was sorry. I was not told that you only had 30 days to use a credit and she said it is company policy that we tell our customers just that. (does it make any sense that I would let a pizza that was my compensation for an incorrect one just expire? I have three teenagers, they eat pizza, a lot of pizza). When I told her I felt like I was mislead about being compensated she HUNG UP ON ME, then would not answer my calls until I called from another number. You know social media can be the death of your business, you know customers talk, you know we will share our awful experiences. Let’s say I have 500 friends on Facebook, and I post about this horrific experience, and my friends share my experience, then some of their friends share it, you see the snowball effect I am getting at. How do you resolve these issues? I was in hospitality and believe as a business, customers have a choice and that when they visit my establishment I go above and beyond to make their experience one they’ll never forget. This particular Pizza Hut is on a service road with Imo’s, Papa John’s and Dominos. While I know your establishment has been there for over 20 years, it doesn’t do the amount of business it used to. I wonder why that is and I’m sure if you look at your revenue reports you would come to the same conclusion. It appears this store has its own philosophy; I’m the owner, I run the store, I can treat customers however I see fit, they’re not worth keeping, we can mess up a pizza and not compensate for it. I work hard for my money, it is my choice to support your business, or I should say I did. My last piece of wisdom for whomever may read this is this; GET BACK TO THE BASICS. YOU WANT TO STAND OUT, FOCUS ON CUSTOMER SERVICE.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-04-01T14:53:51+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10153066421062415_10153068380497415","from":{"id":"924731837571906","name":"Sabrina
