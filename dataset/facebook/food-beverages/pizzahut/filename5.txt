Apparently a call center operator that I keep getting has a strange obsession with bacon. At first when I would call in our order this young lady would try to push bacon onto my order, she was persistent, very pushy. I would firmly and adamantly tell her NO BACON back and then she would ask me why not, is it for strict religious reasons or allergies and I would tell her no, for my mom it's health reasons and for me it's health as well as taste reasons. I feel I shouldn't have to had explained my objection to this girls imposed bacon obsession. One night this girl took it way to far. I went to my favorite Pizza Hut to pick up my order and what do I see? I'm wondering why does this pizza not smell right. I opened the box and I see to my dismay a pizza full of bacon everywhere! Nice joke on me Pizza Hut call center girl. Funny! (Not!) A BBQ bacon pizza instead of a BBQ chicken pizza. F' her! I ended up staying a whole other hour waiting for them to make another pizza and on top of that they kept trying to get me to take home the bacon pizza and I refused. Already this Pizza Hut messed my order up the weekend before by using tobasco sauce instead of BBQ sauce on my BBQ chicken pizza. So disappointing and unusual of this location. I'm hesitant to go back to this location now. Shape up Kahala Pizza Hut and your call center girl too, your going to loose customers and money at this rate if you keep it up. My mom heard the calls between this call center girl and I, mom sees this girl's unnatural obsession for bacon. My mom said this girl must go home to this bacon themed and decorated house. Lol.
