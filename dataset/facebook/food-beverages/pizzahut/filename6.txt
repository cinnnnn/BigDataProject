This time ordered a similar pizza and simply asked for the spinach to be 'cooked in'. Received a call that my request could not be fulfulled - 'corprate policy'. Really? It wasn't a big request and maybe it's trivial, but i guess the customer is always right until he requests to HAVE THE STUPID SPINACH COOKED IN!

This is a large pizza (obviously) half is CLEARLY spinach, olives, mushrooms, and Italian sausage....and cheese good Lord cheese!  but I'm confused I would think the spinach would be baked in with my pizza like everything else not thrown on my pizza last minute by a man with NO GLOVES ON! eww oh so anyways that's half the other half is supposed to be ham and pineapple...yes it has both of those things on it but if you look closely I guess the spinach guy just said no...screw sauce and screw cheese there's a little around the crust but that's about it....btw that crust was supposed to be \"the hut\" crust...ya know the yummy new stuff you all came out with but nope it's just regular. Well that pizza SUCKED to say the least I ended up giving it to hungry teenage boys...they eat anything.
