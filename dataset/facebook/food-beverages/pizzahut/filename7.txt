Tonight I ordered the big dinner box from site #024927. I was less than pleased from the appalling service which I received from cashier Jessica, and the manager or supposed manager Alex. My bread sticks were as hard as a rock, cold, and stale. When I called the site, and complained about it, I was told that another box was on its way.. 30 minutes later that was. As we waited, our hunger continued so we braved it out and ate some pizza. When Alex came to my door, he was less than cordial, and refused to replace the pizza. When we called the store, we got the same service which I got at the door. I asked for the corporate phone number, I was told pizza Hut was a private business, and not a corporation. At the end of the day, we were tired, hungry, and displeased. I continued to call the site, and got hypothetical situations about food at chilies. At the end of the day, I'm not asking for hypothetical's, I'm asking for a solution to the problem. I'm a fair man, I don't want anything more than what I'm entitled to when I pay for food.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-01-13T06:27:11+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152928902307415_10152929342832415","from":{"id":"10205736125698443","name":"Ian O'Brien"},"message":"Please keep the bacon cheese stuffed crust pizza on the menu permanently.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-01-13T01:21:45+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152928902307415_10152929192847415","from":{"id":"975091462522557","name":"Adrian L Frehley"},"message":"Mmmm pizza","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-01-12T23:33:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152928902307415_10152929186057415","from":{"id":"874963289235282","name":"Diana Ingram"},"message":"any specials for the Ducks game tonight? also last couple of time you're pizza seems likes it has less and less cheese sad because we love you're pizza's","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-01-12T23:27:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152928902307415_10152928977342415","from":{"id":"652458828223659","name":"Chelsa Harmon"},"message":"*gag*","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-01-12T21:06:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152928902307415_10152928946992415","from":{"id":"1638091929753386","name":"Hailey Applegate"},"message":"Not awesome","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2015-01-12T20:43:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"10152928902307415_10152928941137415","from":{"id":"1602662006669702","name":"Danni Yurek"},"message":"Weird.

My bread sticks were as hard as a rock, cold, and stale. When I called the site, and complained about it, I was told that another box was on its way.. 30 minutes later that was. As we waited, our hunger continued so we braved it out and ate some pizza. When Alex came to my door, he was less than cordial, and refused to replace the pizza. When we called the store, we got the same service which I got at the door. I asked for the corporate phone number, I was told pizza Hut was a private business, and not a corporation. At the end of the day, we were tired, hungry, and displeased. I continued to call the site, and got hypothetical situations about food at chilies.

Tonight I ordered the big dinner box from site #024927. I was less than pleased from the appalling service which I received from cashier Jessica, and the manager or supposed manager Alex. My bread sticks were as hard as a rock, cold, and stale. When I called the site, and complained about it, I was told that another box was on its way.. 30 minutes later that was. As we waited, our hunger continued so we braved it out and ate some pizza. When Alex came to my door, he was less than cordial, and refused to replace the pizza. When we called the store, we got the same service which I got at the door. I asked for the corporate phone number, I was told pizza Hut was a private business, and not a corporation. At the end of the day, we were tired, hungry, and displeased. I continued to call the site, and got hypothetical situations about food at chilies.

The last three times I've been there I've picked up a pizza that's very lightly cut, and I've had to bust out my pizza cutter and finish the job at home. Either they're using dull cutters or they're being gentle because they don't want to hurt the pizza. If that's the case, can we encourage employees to put some force into it? Just go all Joe Pesci on the pizza? Trust me, the pizza doesn't mind.

Tonight I ordered the big dinner box from site #024927. I was less than pleased from the appalling service which I received from cashier Jessica, and the manager or supposed manager Alex. My bread sticks were as hard as a rock, cold, and stale. When I called the site, and complained about it, I was told that another box was on its way.. 30 minutes later that was. As we waited, our hunger continued so we braved it out and ate some pizza. When Alex came to my door, he was less than cordial, and refused to replace the pizza. When we called the store, we got the same service which I got at the door. I asked for the corporate phone number, I was told pizza Hut was a private business, and not a corporation. At the end of the day, we were tired, hungry, and displeased. I continued to call the site, and got hypothetical situations about food at chilies. At the end of the day, I'm not asking for hypothetical's, I'm asking for a solution to the problem.

As we waited, our hunger continued so we braved it out and ate some pizza. When Alex came to my door, he was less than cordial, and refused to replace the pizza. When we called the store, we got the same service which I got at the door. I asked for the corporate phone number, I was told pizza Hut was a private business, and not a corporation. At the end of the day, we were tired, hungry, and displeased. I continued to call the site, and got hypothetical situations about food at chilies.

My bread sticks were as hard as a rock, cold, and stale. When I called the site, and complained about it, I was told that another box was on its way.. 30 minutes later that was. As we waited, our hunger continued so we braved it out and ate some pizza. When Alex came to my door, he was less than cordial, and refused to replace the pizza. When we called the store, we got the same service which I got at the door. I asked for the corporate phone number, I was told pizza Hut was a private business, and not a corporation. At the end of the day, we were tired, hungry, and displeased. I continued to call the site, and got hypothetical situations about food at chilies.
